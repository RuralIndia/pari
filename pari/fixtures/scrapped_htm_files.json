Media reports in Mumbai on this score reckon that means a loss of up to Rs.10 crore in revenue. As even the pro-corporate newspapers of the city point out, the direct beneficiaries would be Mumbai\u2019s millionaires and billionaires. Film stars and corporate bosses who did not find it difficult to spend crores on buying teams and players. That too, for what the media are fond of calling \u201cthe world\u2019s richest cricket tournament.\u201d Simply put, if it goes through, they\u2019ll be getting tax waivers on the hiring of cheerleaders, among other things. </p> <p>True, this is not the first time that entertainment tax has been waived on cricket matches in Mumbai or elsewhere. The BCCI and its affiliates have always enjoyed political patronage. The difference, which has got even members of the ruling front worked up, is that those raking in the crores in exemptions are for-profit-only groups and individuals. By law, any event, musical or cultural, performance or other, staged for profit must pay entertainment tax. But not the IPL, which will have held 10 matches in Mumbai including the Final.</p> <p>It\u2019s an odd situation. The overwhelming majority of Vidharbha\u2019s farmers do not gain from the farm loan waiver \u2014 because they are too \u201cbig.\u201d That is, they hold more than two hectares of land. But the IPL waiver goes to some of India\u2019s richest millionaires and billionaires. They aren\u2019t too big. And the only reason Vidharbha\u2019s farmers have holdings that exceed the loan waiver\u2019s two-hectare cut-off is because they are dry-land farmers. Their fields are poor, un-irrigated and less productive.</p> <p>The IPL waiver reports come within three weeks of the Comptroller and Auditor General\u2019s report on \u201cFarmer\u2019s Packages\u201d in the State. A performance audit the government of Maharashtra chose to present to the Assembly on April 27, the last day of the session. A day on which, as MLAs say, \u201cthere isn\u2019t enough time to count the pages, let alone read the many documents they push at that time.\u201d Clearly, they were not eager on a discussion of the contents.</p> <p>The very first page of the CAG report tells us why. Despite the State government\u2019s Rs.1075-crore \u201cpackage\u201d for farmers \u201cthe suicides, however, continued unabated and the number increased to 1414 during 2006-07.\u201d The Prime Minister\u2019s visit in mid-2006 and the Centre\u2019s Rs.3750-crore package that followed in July also came the year the suicides increased. As we know from earlier reports, including some in this newspaper, they actually went up in the second half of that year. </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Here is the CAG on the official response: \u201cNo evaluation of the implementation of the packages, in terms of reduction in agrarian distress, was made.\u201d We also learn that tens of crores of rupees aimed at reducing farmer distress were, in fact, never spent. The value of the packages themselves was exaggerated by over Rs.200 crore. Crores were released under some heads with no reference at all to the actual requirement of funds. </p> <p>Other funds, such as those meant \u201cfor increase in production,\u201d were released late. Cheques given to some \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 \u201cwere dishonoured for want of cash in the bank.\u201d The \u201cself-help groups were paid subsidies in excess of admissible norms.\u201d Parts of other funds were not released at all. In head after head, funds were underutilised. This is how lackadaisical the governments were with packages worth a total of Rs.4,825 crore. So what\u2019s Rs.10 crore for the IPL?</p> <p>But the CAG report, which is devastating from start to finish, does not stop at that. It has a clear premonition of things to come. On the \u201cinterest waiver\u201d that followed the Prime Minister\u2019s visit, it says: \u201cWhile reimbursing banks for interest waived on loans, sanction of fresh loans was not ensured.\u201d</p> <p>That is exactly where most farmers now find themselves again after the \u201cmassive farm loan waiver.\u201d Fresh credit is very hard to come by. Distress has not come down. There have been over 360 farm suicides since January this year, about 200 of them post-loan waiver. In the official count, there were 153 in January and February. And of these, only 18 were considered \u201celigible suicides.\u201d That is, only 18 families had any hope of being compensated for losing a breadwinner. The figures for March and April will turn out to be much worse.</p> <p>There was a hope, after Rahul Gandhi\u2019s plea in Parliament, that the two-hectare cut-off point would not be imposed on dry-land farmers in places such as Vidharbha and Anantapur. But it was. The very places whose misery had sparked the idea of a loan waiver now stand mostly excluded from it.</p> <p>There is a very important point the CAG report brings out that tends to get glossed over most of the time. That the farmer\u2019s world is not driven by agriculture alone. Farmers, whose incomes have been plummeting, have been hammered by education and health costs. The commercialisation of those sectors has hurt them, as it has countless millions of other Indians, very badly. That is on top of the stick they\u2019ve taken in agriculture.</p> <p>\u201cDistress amongst farmers on account of cost of education was not measured.\u201d The \u201callocation of funds (Rs.3 crore at Rs.50 lakh per district) for health was meagre ...\u201d It mentions the government\u2019s own survey showing that the health issues were huge and required much larger action.</p> <p>One of the most important things the CAG points to is the State government evading its own findings. In mid-2006, the government organised what was the biggest door-to-door survey of farm households ever done. It covered over 17 lakh households, that is, all farming households in the six \u201ccrisis districts\u201d of Washim, Akola, Yavatmal, Buldhana, Wardha and Amravati. Over a fourth of those families \u2014 that is, more than two million people \u2014 were found to be in \u201cmaximum distress.\u201d And more than three quarters of the rest were in what the report called medium distress.</p> <p>In other words, close to seven million people were in distress in just six districts. That was the finding of the most massive study, powered by over 10,000 field workers. And a report of the State government itself, at that. (See: <em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em>, November 22, 2006)</p> <p>Yet, says the CAG, \u201cthe selection of beneficiaries \u2026 had no relation to the departmental survey conducted for the assessment of distress. As a result, the prioritisation of relief and rehabilitation works considering the distress level of farmers could not be ensured.\u201d Why did the State government ignore its own study? Because the results of that huge survey are, to this day, explosive. Also, de-linking the distress survey from the packages meant you could reward your friends who might never have been in crisis.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>One line recurs in different ways through the CAG report: \u201cAuthenticity of reported expenditure was doubtful in the absence of proper classification of accounts.\u201d Throughout, the report is a catalogue of failure too serious to be written off as \u201cerror.\u201d On inputs, which farmers were desperate to get at reasonable prices, there was poor assistance. Farmers were hit hard by a poor supply of seed when they needed it most. Seed requirements for several crops, suggests the CAG, were simply not taken seriously. \u201cThe estimates were not realistic as these were made based on the amount allocated to this component and not based on actual requirement.\u201d</p> <p>The CAG report captures at the top end, the state of things on the ground. Being a performance audit, it confines itself to that task. It is not a field report. However, the portrait it presents of the government\u2019s performance is a sharply accurate one. A picture that sits perfectly with the chaos at the receiving end below.</p> <p>In the end, this is more than just a report. It is a snapshot, or a series of snapshots, of how governments, particularly the one in Maharashtra, are responding to agrarian distress. The complete apathy, the corruption, the cover-ups, even the contempt for the farmer, that come across. This is a State where all the attention is on the brilliantly-lit, power-guzzling matches of the IPL. It is also a State where many regions face power cuts ranging from 3-16 hours each day. And countless children have completed their examinations without being able to study much. The huge power cuts meant darkness in their homes when they returned from school. </p> <p>The report is about the packages in this State. But if we extend our thinking a bit, it should lead us to reflect on things much larger. On the crisis in the countryside, on those being marginalised or just driven away. On regions beyond this one and on our attitude towards those who grow our food but can less and less afford to eat it themselves. </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p

Only, they\u2019re not contesting against, but for, each other. Their symbols range from a Whistle and a Gas Cylinder to Bangles and a bunch of Bananas. Though pitted against one another, they have a common manifesto and even campaign jointly. These dalit, adivasi and BC farmers are the most fascinating candidates in the bypolls now on in Telangana to four Lok Sabha and 17 Assembl\r\ny seats. </p> <p> </p> <p>All the \u2018Jadcherla 13\u2019 have lost their lands to the Polepally Pharma Special Economic Zone and other projects in Mahbubnagar district. And they now contest the polls to draw attention to their loss. Even while a few work as construction labourers on their own land, raising the very SEZ buildings that will seal their destitution.</p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cOver 41 people have died since the land acquisition process began in 2003,\u201d says an angry Muravat Chandi. She\u2019s a Lambada in the Gundlagadda \u2018Tanda\u2019 (adivasi colony) here. \u201cThat includes three close relatives of mine. Cut off from their land, people are losing their will to live. My family has lost 27 acres to this SEZ. It\u2019s why I\u2019m contesting.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>Seated besides Chandi are young Seenu and Lakshman, sons of Balu one of those who died three months ago. \u201cHaving lost all our land to the SEZ, we had no place to conduct his last rites,\u201d says Seenu. \u201cSo we bought a tiny plot, just a few square feet, for Rs. 5,000. There we cremated him.\u201d This, says a neighbour, \u201cwas a man who once owned several acres of land in his life. But not an inch to receive him in death.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>The story of the mounting toll first appeared in <em style=\"i\">Eenadu</em>, the State\u2019s giant newspaper. \u201cWe confirmed 25 of those deaths\u201d says M.L. Narasimha Reddy, the reporter who broke the story. Officials dismissed these as \u201cdue to natural causes.\u201d But the adivasis say their demise was hastened by trauma and demoralisation. After a struggle during which the Lambadas refused to perform the last rites of their dead, the government assigned them six acres. Four for the tanda to live on and two for a burial ground.</p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re killing us \u2014 and they kindly give us a graveyard,\u201d says Dharmia, Chandi\u2019s neighbour, with dark humour. \u201cIt\u2019s the only place we can go to. No one in this tanda of 80 households has a job outside of farming.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Chandi and 12 more from other groups are independents \u201cas both major political parties backed this SEZ.\u201d In 2003, the then Telugu Desam government notified a \u2018Green Park\u2019 and began acquiring 969 acres of land. Much of these belonged to the dalits and Lambadas. Including government assigned lands given to them earlier to better their lives. \u201cWe were first told there was to be a Leather Park,\u201d says Etti Linagaih (candidate symbol: Gas Cylinder) in Polepally village. \u201cThen came the Green Park idea. And now the SEZ. They take our land first and make their plans later.\u201d In 2005 the new Congress government enforced the plans. In all, the SEZ and other projects have displaced some 350 families.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the eyes of the official machinery, everything was done by the book. The SEZ was legally notified and the land losers paid off. No one was left out. \u201cSure,\u201d says a chorus of voices. \u201cFor the government-assigned land they declared Rs. 18,000 an acre. For patta land held by us, Rs. 32,000 to Rs. 50,000. And we never received the full amount of even such a pittance.\u201d Land rates in the region, adjacent to the national highway, are worth over Rs. 20 lakhs an acre.</p> <p> </p> <p>Officials point to the fact that the land losers accepted the cheques. \u201cCertainly,\u201d says candidate Chandi. \u2018Take your cheque now or never. You will go to jail and get nothing.\u2019 These were the sort of things we were told. Our consent never mattered.\u2019 The low rates aside, there was no other compensation. House sites were spoken of but not seen. Some land losers were given work at construction sites. But many are too old to be able to do that kind of labour.</p> <p> </p> <p>Eight of the 13 candidates speak to us in Polepally. It\u2019s a curious sight. Eight contenders seated together agreeing vociferously with every word the others said. Each of them has lost all his or her land. Distress sales of cattle have decimated their few other assets. The family of T. Mogilamma (symbol: Brick) have lost their eight acres. And sold off 16 buffaloes and cows for just Rs. 20,000. \u201cWe could no longer feed them, anyway.\u201d Most of the others have done the same. Jangilamma (symbol: Battery Torch) who has lost seven acres, also sold off four head of cattle for just Rs. 1,000. </p> <p> </p> <p>In the Lambada tanda, a once relatively prosperous tribal group faces ruin. \u201cMost of the families here had 50-60 buffaloes,\u201d says Dharmia. \u201cMost have sold half or more at dismal prices.\u201d And says candidate Chandi, \u201cwe have borewells on that acquired land. What happens to those?\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cWeddings are paralysed,\u201d says Jangilamma back in Polepally. \u201cNo one wants to marry into our disaster-hit groups. We have no land, no assets.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Meanwhile, the price rise is also taking a toll on a community for whom the bottom has fallen out of the world. Some of the candidates often go hungry, trying to keep their children fed. \u201cFrom soap to dal, every item is much costlier. To tell you the truth, some of us are down to begging to feed the kids,\u201d says Satyamma (symbol: cupboard). \u201cWe are contesting these elections to highlight the injustice done to us,\u201d says Lingaiah. </p> <p>But why should 13 of them contest the same seat? Wouldn\u2019t it make sense to have just one common candidate?</p> <p> Lingaiah knows they cannot win. \u201cOur strategy is to lower the votes of the main parties. Each of us will draw the votes of his or her own group. That\u2019s why so many of us. In fact, we wanted to put up 150 candidates for this seat. But most could not raise the Rs. 5,000 security deposit required.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>It\u2019s a simple strategy of protest with no pretensions of winning. \u201cIt\u2019s more honest,\u201d says Hyderabad-based journalist Uma Maheshwari, \u201cthan the middle class as elite parties that spring up claiming to end corruption and transform society.\u201d </p> <p>The aim of the Polepally anti-SEZ protesters is modest: \"That we get our land back, our lives back. Our one and only demand.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>As their common leaflet puts it: \u201cGiving us house sites and rice at Rs. 2 a kilo clearly means taking away lands from farmers\u201d and giving them to big industries. There is a poignancy to their manifesto which makes no promises. \u201cVoting for the Polepally farmers means saluting with love our Mother Earth who has been bearing our weight since ages.\u201d</p>

It quoted Sir William Haley, Editor of <em style=\"i\">The Times </em>as forecasting a struggle between newspapers and television. Speaking in London on May 1, 1958, he said newspapers would have to \u201crethink our production, advertising, finances and staff policy, fighting for anything we believe in, namely the written word.\u201d</p> <p>That was when TV had not made inroads in India. But in the mid-1980s when I was News Editor in <em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em>, the Editor cautioned me: the challenge from TV is coming up (there was only Doordarshan then) and the paper would have to reorient itself and change the way news was packaged and presented \u2014 moving away from bare narration of facts to provide background, analysis and interpretation, to make the newspaper different from TV.</p> <p>Twenty years on, these words get a new emphasis when the challenge to newspapers is tougher in the digital age. As a report for the World Editors Forum points out (<em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em>\r\n<em style=\"i\">\u2013Business Line</em>, May 7, 2008), newspapers must innovate, integrate, or perish. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on comment and opinion. While newspapers have survived the competition from TV, the challenge is more serious now. The report forecasts that the most common form of news consumption will be through the digital media, such as online or mobiles, within a decade. The number of young people reading newspapers is declining in mature media markets. </p> <p style=\"center\">*\u2002*\u2002*\u2002</p> <p>The challenges ahead call for new thinking. Major newspapers abroad now have stories appear first on their websites and then, perhaps in a different form, in the print edition. This makes news a continuous process with revision and updating going on, including inputs from readers who become participants, not mere consumers of the product. Citizen journalists, now seen on television, will also play a part in newspapers, which can no longer afford to brush them off. Such participation, in my view, will be mutually beneficial \u2014 new ideas, facts from one side and the needed perspective from the other.</p> <p>The new medium of blogs cannot be a real competitor to the old and established media; blogs are mostly dependent on the print media for their content and do not have much original reporting. But where they have original content, this can provide material for a newspaper to develop.</p> <p style=\"center\">*\u2002*\u2002*\u2002</p> <p>Has the need for a totally different approach from what is seen on TV been fully understood? Visually yes, content wise, no. Most of the stories on Page 1 have already been seen/heard on the electronic media the previous day. That gives one the feeling that the content is driven by TV. Rarely is there something exclusive, totally new. With such content, how can the page retain reader interest?</p> <p>The picture is often different on the inside pages. There are stories that generally do not interest TV where the emphasis is on the visuals, on action. But even these stories in the print medium can do with better, crisper presentation to draw and hold reader attention. The attraction of the inside pages however is not a recent phenomenon. I recall my Editor telling me that he looked first at the inside pages before he turned to Page 1.</p> <p style=\"center\">*\u2002*\u2002*\u2002</p> <p>It is a matter for comfort that <em style=\"i\">The Hindu </em>does not resort to dumbing down news on these pages to titillate the reader. Its coverage does not result in a \u201cstructural shutout\u201d of the poor, which P. Sainath highlighted in his address at the convocation of the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, on May 3, 2008. No doubt corporate affairs and events get extensive coverage, but there is no \u201ccorporate hijack\u201d that he sees in the media world in general, nor is there any \u201cprivileged right of corporate giants.\u201d But there is another kind of hijacking that reader S. Sivaraman (Srirangam) refers to \u2014 by political parties resulting in newspapers abdicating their responsibility to the public to give them the full picture.</p> <p>Sainath decried the failure of the media to report in adequate detail events like the current crises in food, agriculture, and labour. <em style=\"i\">The Hindu </em>has been devoting a lot of space to the impact of the spurting prices on the public. This is the supply end of the food chain. The production angle also needs equal, if not more, attention. There are many constraints and bottlenecks in agricultural production and also a shift from foodgrain production to commercial crops. These await a detailed critical study. Agricultural economics is a specialised field that needs, but does not get, expert coverage. Sainath has done commendable work in highlighting the humanitarian crisis on the farm front. The other areas too need attention. Labour issues are now a totally neglected area.</p> <p>There was however one point in the report of the veteran journalist\u2019s speech that made my eyebrows go up. Sainath urged journalism graduates to \u201ccorrect the failings of the Indian media in the last decade.\u201d Can any journalist employee in a newspaper rectify its lapses? What then can the new entrants do?</p> <p style=\"center\">*\u2002*\u2002*\u2002</p> <p>There was another report on the media (May 2, 2008) that raised doubts in me. \u201cMore Indians want media without government control\u201d was the headline of a Washington report of a survey by \u201c<em style=\"i\">WorldPublicOpinion.org</em>\u201d to commemorate World Press Freedom day. The headline, I thought, was dubious as also the statement in the report that \u201ca modest majority of Indians realised the importance of media freedom.\u201d Does one conclude that there are Indians who want government control over the media and that media freedom does not exist in India?</p> <p>One-third of the respondents (there was no indication of the size of the sample surveyed or its physical distribution), the report said, felt the government should have the right \u201cto prevent the media from publishing things that could be politically destabilising.\u201d If true, that is a dangerous view \u2014 who is to decide what will be \u201cdestabilising\u201d? There were more views on similar lines in the report.</p> <p>\r\n<em style=\"i\"> <a href=\"mailto:readerseditor@thehindu.co.in\">readerseditor@thehindu.co.in</a>\r\n</em>\r\n</p> <p

There have been nearly 60 heat wave deaths here in two months, the highest for any district in Andhra Pradesh this\r\n year. His passbook shows he has worked 39 days at the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act site since such work began at his village of Tatikolu. At the other end of the age spectrum are many in their early teens trying to pass off as adults in order to get some work and help out their families.</p> <p>Hunger and rising prices are driving the old and the very young to the work. In this time of crisis, \u201cNREG work\u201d is their lifeline. </p> <p>Gadasu Ramulu thinks it\u2019s a good programme. \u201cIt should be there,\u201d he says. His wife Anjamma insists: \u201cListen, it\u2019s essential. We won\u2019t eat without it.\u201d </p> <p>Then why does the record show he only worked three days at the site in the past 10 days or so? \u201cLook at me,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is hard work and it is very hot. So typically I work four days and rest four days. I cannot do it continuously for a week. Sometimes I find other work that might pay less but is lighter. I\u2019d like to do both, actually. In truth, you do what you get \u2014 and what you can manage physically.\u201d</p> <p>His household includes a daughter \u2014 and her children \u2014abandoned by her husband. All the adults do \u201cwhatever work we can find.\u201d Including Anjamma who is past 65. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s burning the energy he has,\u201d she says of Ramulu. \u201cWhich is bad when we are eating less. But what is the option? That\u2019s why he has to take a break every few days.\u201d </p> <p>The family does not have an Antyodaya card (that is meant for the poorest of the poor) that would make their food cheaper. At the NREG site he can make \u201cup to Rs. 80 a day.\u201d In the lean times, that makes the difference between \u201csomething and nothing.\u201d She adds: \u201cWithout it, we\u2019d be in far more trouble.\u201d</p> <p>More than three million people have found some work at NREG sites across Andhra Pradesh. Nobody here calls it by that name, though. It\u2019s <em style=\"i\">nooru rojula pani </em>(a hundred days\u2019 work), or \u201cgovernment work.\u201d </p> <p>Here, in Devarkonda mandal, the average daily wage at such sites is around Rs. 84. It is possible, though not easy, to get private work that is higher-paid than that, on some days. As a neighbour puts it, applying  an old Telugu saying: \u201cRather than running to drink milk, better to stand still and drink water.\u201d </p> <p>It might seem an odd analogy, since the work that she, Ramulu and others do at the NREG site can be, and is, very heavy. \u201cBut at least it\u2019s there,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Across several worksites in the districts of Nalgonda and Mahbubnagar are others who are well into their sixties, actively seeking such work. We also ran into at least three others close to Ramulu\u2019s age returning to labour in order to eat. Being malnourished makes the work that much harder. </p> <p>Things are bad at home, too. \u201cAll the children here go without milk,\u201d says Anasuya in Tatikolu. \u201cThis year, with the costs shooting up, the chance doesn\u2019t arise of their having it.\u201d Her husband is the field assistant at the local NREG site.</p> <p>\u201cAt least 40 children have had to be turned away from the work site,\u201d says her neighbour in this Dalit colony. \u201cFamilies are terribly hungry. Yes, the rice at Rs. 2 a kg is there for some, but it has only just come in.\u201d And milk which was around Rs. 12 a litre is now between Rs. 16-18 a litre. \u201cAnd those with bigger families, or widows with orphans, are having a bad time of it. Some days, people borrow money to buy food.\u201d Often, girls of 12 or 13 wear sarees and try to appear more mature than they are, in order to get work. </p> <p>\u201cWhat can people do?\u201d asks Lakshmamma, a widow herself. She gets work now and then at the site. \u201cMy job is to pour water over the spot to be dug to make it less hard.\u201d </p> <p>Young Damodar, who first tapped NREG work when he was 15, dropped out of school after his father died. He goes to work on some days with his mother. \u201cA widow has to be accompanied by someone,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise, getting work can be difficult.\u201d </p> <p>Villagers complain that the work they get is often too hard. \u201cTry digging for hours in this heat.\u201d And the price rise is making things a lot worse with people being hungry and eating less. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is going downwards in steps,\u201d says Krishnaiah. \u201cFirst, people change the type of food and go in for poorer quality which is cheaper. They move to the cheapest vegetables, then no vegetables at all. Then they give up milk. That\u2019s how the changes come.\u201d Amongst the changes is that older people, particularly older widows, get much less to eat within the household.</p> <p>Krishnaiah is among the more fit and fortunate ones, who also goes out to do stone-breaking work at a higher rate of wages at private sites. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t come always and it is even harder to do. The stones are terribly hot. The tools also get very hot. Your feet are burning all the time.\u201d </p> <p>That, say the others, is the case with all of them. \u201cWe work to meet our hunger, but we burn up the food we eat with that work.\u201d</p> <p>The complaints are many and often justified. People are sometimes exasperated by the way the NREGA system works. But there is unanimity on its worth and value. It\u2019s hard to find a single poor person here who says the programme is of no use, that it ought to be wound up. </p> <p>\u201cIt keeps us going,\u201d says Gadasu Ramulu. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s right here, in our village. We need this.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008053055591100.htm&amp;date=2008/05/30/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2008/05/30/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduretailplus.com/\">Retail Plus</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2008053055301000.htm\">The Republic  of Nepal</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2008053055291000.htm\">Continuing quest for life on Mars</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2008053055451000.htm\">The rise of Asia &amp;

It usually is, in the month of May. This village in Mahbubnagar district of Telangana falls in the belt known for some of the highest levels of migration in south India each year. </p> <p>This time, though, the people of Kondapur are not too far off. They\u2019re repairing a nearby tank. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) is helping to keep people at work in their own villages. </p> <p>There has been a steep fall in distress migration from Kondapur. \u201cThere are over 200 of us at this site alone,\u201d says D. Ramulamma, one of the workers here. \u201cLast year, all of us were out of the district. Most were outside the State.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a small but significant statistic. There are now 28 bus services a week leaving this district in Telangana for Mumbai. Three to five years ago, that number was 42 to 45 a week. That\u2019s a sharp fall in the number of bus trips carting migrants from Mahbubnagar to Mumbai.</p> <p>In many of those years, you\u2019d have found most of Kondapur on the buses. And other villages, too. This correspondent did, in 2003, boarding one of them that year. (\u201cThe bus to Mumbai,\u201d <em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em> Sunday Magazine, June 1, 2003.) The bus to Mumbai was their route to survival. A hope of work and income in the off-agriculture seasons. </p> <p>This is one of the most backward districts of Andhra Pradesh. With a population of over 35 lakh, seasonal migrations of up to five lakh were considered \u2018normal.\u2019 There were years \u2014 like 2003 \u2014 when fully a third of that population had migrated in desperate search of work.</p> <p>V. Chittiamma now earns in a week almost what she made in a month as a migrant just three years ago. She can bring in up to Rs. 90 a day here, or Rs. 630 in seven days. \u201cIn Madhya Pradesh, where I used to go for work, I got a maximum of Rs. 700 a month.\u201d Sometimes less. </p> <p>\u201cI used to go to Kadapa and Kurnool then,\u201d says V. Bharatamma. \u201cAnd worked for a pittance of Rs. 25 to 30 a day. Now we don\u2019t have to leave our children behind. Nor take them with us on long, tiring and unhealthy journeys.\u201d </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>In 2003, the district was dotted with \u201cgruel centres,\u201d set up by political or charitable groups, trying to meet the acute hunger that haunted Andhra Pradesh that season. Mahbubnagar and Anantapur districts alone had over 200 of these makeshift public kitchens. In one place, this correspondent recorded the presence of even sarpanchas in the long and hungry queues lining up for gruel. There was one centre right here in Kondapur, set up by a group of journalists. (\u201cHi-tech, low nutrition,\u201d <em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em> Sunday Magazine, June 22, 2003.) But the centres no longer exist. </p> <p>The problem of hunger is far from over, though. Rising prices have driven several people in their sixties (and one above 70) to work at this site. But this time round, the families have slightly more money than they did earlier. \u201cFood costs are just terrible,\u201d says Bharatamma. \u201cAll prices are up, even of gold,\u201d mocks a friend of hers, to a chorus of protests: \u201cWe can\u2019t buy food, let alone gold for marriages. When did you start looking at gold prices?\u201d</p> <p>Every family speaks of eating less. But since they do not have to travel far, they escape the many costs tied up with migration. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending on travel, and with some income we can manage food better in our own village.\u201d However, the fall in food intake is serious and tells painfully on their bodies. And health costs are hurting them badly, too. Hundreds of poorly nourished people labour at these sites in temperatures above 43 degrees Celsius. </p> <p>The impact of the NREG on migrations is equally vivid in Lambapur in Nalgonda district. \u201cOver 300 people here are getting work,\u201d says Lashkar in this adivasi village of P.A. Palli mandal. \u201cWe used to journey to Guntur or Miryalaguda, or dozens of other places,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Here, too, the NREG scores. \u201cWe used to get Rs. 50 a day per male worker,\u201d says Lashkar. \u201cA four-member family made Rs. 200 a day, of which at least Rs. 100 went on food and other essentials. Often more. Now each of us can earn Rs. 90 a day right here.\u201d For Lashkar himself, \u201cit\u2019s good to be home.\u201d He adds: \u201cFor the first time in years, no one has migrated.\u201d</p> <p>School attendance has gone up. \u201cWe had to take the little ones when we went away for up to three months. Now they go to school.\u201d </p> <p>Or did, till the summer vacation. Like in most \u2018tandas\u2019 (adivasi colonies) the state of schooling and literacy remains pretty dismal. But the Lambadas feel there has been a relative improvement. And as in many tandas, the records of everything \u2014 schooling, NREG work, all of it \u2014 are a total and complete mess. Yet the evidence is simple and compelling. Two years ago, most houses in Nambapur would have been deserted. </p> <p>They, too, have complaints about the high prices of food. \u201cNow the shopkeeper says, \u2018you are earning nearly Rs. 100, you can pay more,\u2019\u201d laughs one Lambada. \u201cBut seriously, what they are giving with one hand they remove with the other. Something has to be done about these food prices.\u201d With milk costs rising, children in many households do not drink it at all. The NREG work is hard and the heat is killing. Local media have reported close to 60 heat wave deaths in Nalgonda in two months, the highest for any district in Andhra Pradesh. But the Lambadas still rate their work conditions as better than in past years. </p> <p>In Vadlaparthi village of the same district, too, NREG work has curbed migrations. \u201cOver 70 people from our S.C. colony have got work. All were migrants last year,\u201d says B. Devaiah. He thinks the <em style=\"i\">nooru rojula pani</em> (or a \u2018hundred days of work\u2019 as the NREG is called in these parts) is \u201clife-saving.\u201d Where most families migrated to diverse destinations just three years ago, \u201cthere are almost none who have left this year.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Kondapur, Bharatamma has this take on the NREG: \u201cThis work, these wages \u2014 and better food prices, why can\u2019t we have it all? I\u2019m sure the government can do it if it wants to.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font

They did it again on Sunday \u2014 by helping defeat the sitting Telangana Rashtra Samithi MLA, even as every one of them lost his or her own security deposit. </p> <p>The 13 farmers contesting the Jadcherla seat in Telangana \u2014 who lost their lands to the Polepally Pharma Special Economic Zone \u2014 together drew a total of over 8,000 votes. That is, four times Congress candidate Mallu Ravi\u2019s victory margin over the Telugu Desam Party\u2019s Erra Sekhar.</p> <p>The effort of these mainly Dalit, backward caste and Adivasi farmers \u2014 a protest to draw attention to their loss of land \u2014 torpedoed the sitting TRS MLA, Lakshma Reddy. He drew less than 21,000 votes and came third. Both his Congress and TDP rivals drew more than twice that number each.</p> <p>As many as 350 families have lost all their land \u2014 some 969 acres \u2014 to the Pharma SEZ (<em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em>, May 26, 2008). But even if these families had three votes each, the Jadcherla 13 drew several times that number in sympathy. That is, there is clear evidence of a much wider sympathy for them. Not only did they lose their land, they got no compensation beyond a pittance per acre. </p> <p>The land acquired by the government for the SEZ is adjacent to the national highway. It is also not far from the Shamshabad airport. Land rates in the region are thus well above Rs.20 lakh per acre. Often even higher than that. But the displaced farmers got sums ranging from Rs.18,000 to Rs.50,000 an acre, way below the prevailing market rates.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Though rival contenders for the seat, these farmers fought on a common manifesto and campaigned jointly. Their declared aim was \u201cto lower the votes of the main parties.\u201d An aim they appear to have achieved. As one of the 13, Lingaiah, told <em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em>: \u201cActually, we wanted to put 150 candidates.\u201d Which would certainly have drawn away even more votes from the major parties. But they could not as most could not afford the Rs.5,000 security deposit required.</p> <p>Of them, Mala Jangilamma \u2014 who has sold four head of cattle in distress for just Rs.1,000 \u2014 netted the highest number of votes, 1771. </p> <p>Chandi, an Adivasi, got 892. Together with their contesting colleagues \u2014 and two other independents who backed them \u2014 the Jadcherla 13 pulled in over 8,000 votes. Their manifesto made no promises and their only demand was and remains \u201cwe get our lands back, we get our lives back.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p>

Somamma in Mosangi. A strange question, with the mercury blazing past 43 Celsius in the Nalgonda village and all of us cowering in the little shade we can find. </p> <p>\u201cWhy would you want to send the kids to school in this heat, Somamma?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cAt least there,\u201d she says, \u201cthey got one decent meal a day. I can\u2019t afford to give them one now, during the vacation.\u201d</p> <p>In Kondapur in Mahbubnagar district, Bharatamma echoes that demand. \u201cWhen the schools are closed, there is no mid-day meal. That means, instead of getting to eat, the children go to work. How else does the family manage?\u201d Hit by rising food prices, poor families can\u2019t afford one more meal. For those with two children in school, the costs really go up. When the schools are open, you can find some young ones saving a part of their meal for a hungry grandparent at home.</p> <p>Back in Mosangi, Somamma\u2019s son Bikshapati says he preferred the mid-day meal at school to food at home. \u201cIt was better,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got dal, rice, tomatoes, rasam, even eggs.\u201d Much of that is beyond his family\u2019s reach now. If he and his family are able to pull on at all, it\u2019s because of the work the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act brings to their village. In Mosangi, there is bitterness over how it has worked. In Kondapur, where it has done better, there are some complaints. Yet, in the eyes of all them, this is the most important programme the countryside has seen in years.</p> <p>There are complaints of rip-offs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been paid only Rs.30 a day,\u201d says an angry P. Mallamma in Mosangi. The record says they got Rs.84 a day. K. Kalamma says she has \u201cworked for over a month, without being paid.\u201d Even a former deputy sarpanch, Saiddulu, has not been paid for a week\u2019s work. He is well over 60 \u2014 yet another older person returning to work, driven by food costs. But he is clear that the work the NREGA brings is \u201cvery vital to us. It should run well, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Three major issues confront a programme that is the lifeline of these communities at this time. Two of these are built into it. \u201cWhy only 100 days of work,\u201d ask people. And they do not get those 100 days fully. The second is the rule of only one member per family being able to use it. In Andhra Pradesh, very sensibly, field assistants at NREG sites are breaking that rule. It is possible to see husband and wife together at the same site. That\u2019s as far as it goes, though.</p> <p>Poor families see themselves as a collective. \u201cOne family member cannot go to Guntur to work and another to the site,\u201d says Lashkar in Lambapur village. Splitting up is bad economics. A day\u2019s wage at a brick kiln might be less than what it is for NREG work. But though brick kilns are brutal and exploitative, all members of a family can work there \u2014 and for more than a hundred days. These two restrictions hobble a programme people say they badly need. </p> <p>Third are the usual local problems. Payment delays for one. Though Andhra Pradesh seems to be ahead of several other States, this remains a problem. \u201cPeople here have waited four months to get much less than what was owed to them,\u201d says Mallamma. \u201cPeople are recorded as working when they did not work. Others are not recorded as working when they did,\u201d says B. Ramaiah in Vadlaparthi village of Nalgonda. Lambapur in the same district throws up this kind of paradox. This is a village where NREG work has dramatically curbed migrations. There is no one who will tell you things have not improved. Yet, most \u201cpassbooks\u201d show zero days of work. This is an adivasi \u2018tanda\u2019 with very low literacy and education. The records are a mess and a formal audit would conclude there has been a disaster. But Lambapur has done well out of the NREGA. To make it more complex, the reverse could be true in Mosangi. The records would show Mosangi has done better, which it has not. Everywhere is the backlash from the old contractor-local official-low bureaucracy that feels threatened by the NREGA. Capturing the records and the process is part of the fightback. In at least two other States, activists promoting the NREGA have been killed. </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Yet Andhra Pradesh has fared better, thanks to the growing awareness of people of their rights. Even at the start, 2.7 million people applied for job cards in the first month after the programme was announced. From top officials in the State\u2019s NREGA team to unions of landless labourers, many have worked hard to promote the programme</p> <p>In this process, a small but vital reordering of power relations is under way. The NREGA is having multiple and layered effects. With better wages, the bargaining power of the weakest has gone up a notch. For some, their access to costly services like health has risen slightly. NREG work has been a lifejacket in the flood waters of the price rise. And no other programme has had the positive impact on distress migrations that it has achieved.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not just low level officials,\u201d laughs a very senior official in Delhi. \u201cThere is hostility right here at top levels of bureaucracy and politicians. There are efforts on to make it less attractive to people needing work. Complaints that the NREGA is raising wages and hurting farmers are being used to push for limiting that wage. And making even those 100 days of work harder to access. This would be disastrous. But it seems certain such efforts will soon follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, there is much scope for improvement,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could get people to participate more in choosing the kind of works needed locally. We could provide better technical support and advice. Restrictions on the number of days and family members could be sorted out by making it more universal.\u201d And by aligning it to works that benefit the whole community, including local farmers, some of those other problems could also be met. </p> <p>In Tatikolu village, Lakshmamma hopes the programme will continue. She is up against a powerful combine of forces entrenched in the countryside and ensconced in Delhi\u2019s power elite. A widow with young children, she finds it hard to get work at the site to begin with. Seated in her bleak home, she wonders when her food supply will run out. And hopes the NREG work won\u2019t. \u201cWithout it, I don\u2019t know what we would do.\u201d</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p>

It\u2019s what they did in Hingoli in Maharashtra. That was a week ago, but the police are still, in a sense, involved in its distribution there and elsewhere. In Hingoli itself, there are lots of policeman controlling the queues outside dealers\u2019 outlets. The dealers won\u2019t open up otherwise. Thanks to the police, Hingoli\u2019s farmers got some fertilizer. Sort of giv\r\nes a whole new meaning to the acronym PDS. Police Distribution System. </p> <p>In Nanded, cops lathicharged angry farmers demanding fertilizer needed urgently with the rains setting in. In Akola, there is heavy police bandobast for the same reasons. More than one Agriculture Officer has fled his workplace to escape mobs. There were angry outbursts at the market place in the chief minister\u2019s own constituency at Latur. Protests in neighbouring Karnataka have grabbed national attention with a farmer being shot dead. In Andhra Pradesh, farmers stormed zilla parishad meetings in Medak and Rangareddy and set up road blocks in other districts.</p> <p>In Vidharbha\u2019s cotton belt, for all the celebration of Bt\u2019s success, there have been huge shifts towards soybean. That\u2019s because soybean costs much less to grow than cotton. At least for now. Soybean needs less fertilizer than cotton. But needs it at the time of sowing, just as the rains set in. In Madhya Pradesh\u2019s, \u201csoya bowl,\u201d the shortages are hurting. And for years now, more farmers have been joining the soybean bandwagon in other states, too</p> <p>At the very least, it argues that government was unprepared for the agricultural season. The shortages had been predicted for a long time. Not just fertilizer, but seeds as well. In Maharashtra, the state argues that the Gujjar agitation has crippled freight train traffic, hence the shortages. This may well be a real factor, but it is not going to account for the 60 per cent shortfall in supply. </p> <p>Even if we tide over the present crisis, fertilizer troubles will worsen. Many complex factors are asserting themselves. Some of the very things that happened with grain and food prices are at work with fertilizer as well. The corporate conquest of agriculture is well apace. As the <em style=\"i\">Wall Street Journal</em> (April 30, 2008) notes: \u201cAt a time when parts of the world are facing food riots, Big Agriculture is dealing with a different sort of challenge: huge profits.\u201d The <em style=\"i\">WSJ</em> points to the grain-processing giant Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., which saw a 42 per cent leap in its fiscal third quarter profits. \u201cIncluding a sevenfold increase in net income in its unit that stores, transports and trades grains such as wheat and corn, as well as soybeans.\u201d</p> <p>Seed and Herbicide giant Monsanto and fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. \u201call reported similar windfalls in their latest quarters.\u201d As the <em style=\"i\">WSJ</em> grudgingly says: \u201cSome observers think financial speculation has helped push up prices as wealthy investors in the past year have flooded the agriculture commodity markets in search of better returns.\u201d So much so that \u201cThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week held a hearing in Washington to examine the role index funds and other speculators are playing in driving up grain prices.\u201d The <em style=\"i\">WSJ</em> cites research showing that total index fund investment in corn, soybean, wheat, cattle and hogs has risen by 37 billion dollars (which is well over double India\u2019s farm loan waiver for millions of farmers) since 2006.</p> <p>Now, it\u2019s the turn of the <em style=\"i\">New York Times</em> (June 5, 2008) to note that \u201ca few big private investors are starting to make bolder and longer-term bets that the world\u2019s need for food will greatly increase \u2014 by buying farmland, fertilizer, grain elevators and shipping equipment.\u201d One company has bought about five dozen fertilizer distribution outlets and a fleet of barges and ships. And others, \u201cincluding the giant BlackRock fund group in New York, are separately planning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in agriculture, chiefly farmland, from sub-Saharan Africa to the English countryside.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the <em style=\"i\">NYT</em> and <em style=\"i\">WSJ</em> also parrot corporate  chant that this could be a good thing for hungry humanity. \u201cThese new bets by big investors could bolster food production at a time when the world needs more of it,\u201d says the <em style=\"i\">NYT</em> report. And the <em style=\"i\">WSJ</em> notes that food companies \u201csay bigger profits can be used to develop new technologies that will ultimately help farmers improve productivity. Monsanto says it\u2019s designing improved genetically modified seeds that can squeeze even more yield from each acre of planted grain.\u201d Gee! They\u2019re the good guys, actually. In the <em style=\"i\">WSJ</em>\u2019s eyes (June 10, 2008) the villains are elsewhere. The problems arise with \u201cChina and India gobbling food as never before and food prices soaring\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Complex as the reality is, the principles are fairly simple. At a time when debates in India highlight the un-viability of agriculture, giant corporations are betting the opposite. For them, at least, it holds the promise of an undying source of super profit. The <em style=\"i\">NYT</em> report\u2019s headline sums it up nicely: \u201cFood is gold, so billions invested in farming.\u201d Ultimately, you can live without a lot of things, yes, even television. Or aircraft and SUVs. But you cannot live without food and water. The latter \u201ccommodity\u201d is the focus of the biggest thrust of some huge multinational companies. And we are well into the process of privatising water in India (for them). A process that promises chaos, misery and conflict on a scale we cannot begin to grasp at this point.</p> <p>Across the globe, the entire chain of resources and inputs is now getting cornered by corporations. Farm land, water, fertilizer, seed, pesticide and many more. Grab these together and you\u2019ve got the world by its belly. The giant companies are now putting out papers on how they will solve the world\u2019s food problem. Never mind they are at the heart of it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, making chemical fertilizer requires large use of fossil fuels. So rising oil prices further spur the fertilizer crisis. The rip-off by the top corporations in that sector has been so great that even the United States Senate saw moves to impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies. (In India, the government responded to such calls by transferring the burden to the people and asking for \u201cpatience on the inflationary trend.\u201d) Of course, it was scotched in the Senate, too.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Fertilizer subsidies in India have for long gone to manufacturers, not farmers. (If they went to farmers directly, they would have more choice in what fertilizer to use.) Meanwhile, the world over, speculative capital has been moving towards agricultural commodities and fertilizer. Other sectors in the stock markets have tanked or not done so well. In India, too, calls for a ban on futures trading in agricultural commodities arose from such a situation. Wheat went underground for a while. Prices rose (and keep rising). Now it is the turn of fertilizer. A bag of Diammonium Phosphate today costs Rs. 490 officially. In black, it sells for around Rs. 600. (The global price, far more under corporate control, is at least four times as much. That makes imports more difficult.) Even our nominal price is nearly three times what it was 15 years ago. </p> <p>For well over a decade now, we have invested less and less in agriculture. Following the World Bank-IMF menu, we discouraged food crop and focused on cash crop and sang the hymns of export-led growth. Mindless de-regulation saw corporate control grip more sectors of agriculture. Seed, fertilizer, markets, you name it. We reduced our agricultural universities to labs for private corporations. We stepped up our use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Millions of farmers were shifted to a much higher-cost economy where input costs are crippling. A (non-organic) farmer in 1991 could cultivate an acre of cotton in Vidharbha for Rs. 2,500. Today that would cost him or her Rs. 13,000 or more. That is, with all the miracles of chemicals, pesticides and Bt. </p> <p>As these costs shot up, we disabled our capacities to meet the needs of the cultivator. And then we withdrew credit. Even if the fertilizer comes through this season, countless farmers in the post-loan waiver world find themselves without fresh credit. \u201cWe\u2019re not mad,\u201d say bank managers in crisis regions. \u201cThe farmer has no new income. Nor better prices. How will someone who could not repay Rs. 10,000 repay thrice that sum?\u201d So who do farmers seeking credit turn to? The very input dealers who are emerging the major source of informal credit in the countryside. And who are implicated in the black marketing of vital inputs in every crisis.</p> <p>The fertilizer shortage might even be overcome just now. But the crisis won\u2019t go away. It and many more to come are built into both, what\u2019s going on in world capitalism \u2014 and what we have been doing in India. We\u2019ve dismantled vital parts of our agriculture and with it, the livelihoods of millions. This at a time when the World Bank and IMF are trying to hide their tracks in the trail of disaster they left the world over. A study by the Bank\u2019s economists now says that \u201ceconomic growth of the agriculture sector is at least twice as effective at reducing poverty as any other sector.\u201d (<em style=\"i\">The Wall Street Journal</em>, June 10, 2008). And we fail to see why food costs could get a lot worse. The corporations do, though. As that <em style=\"i\">NYT</em> headline puts it: \u201cFood is gold, so billions invested in farming.\u201d Or, more truly, in the capture of it.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p

There could be serious trouble otherwise.\u201d Almost every officer and constable at the station, which appears under siege, are deployed here, right within their own compound. Only, the enforcers of law and order are not fighting angry mobs or staving off a terror attack. They\u2019re distributing fertilizer to furious farmers.</p> <p>They are organising them into queues, creating lists and verifying coupons. And directing the close to 200 peasants crowding the station yard over a mike and public address system. There\u2019s a tragi-comical touch to it. Rarely has fertilizer been distributed under such tight security, by men in uniform. The cops are as bemused by the situation as the farmers are.</p> <p>Fertilizer shortages have sparked unrest across large swathes of rural Maharashtra and other States as well. In Washim, they hit particularly hard. Washim is a part of Vidharbha where soybean overtook cotton a few seasons ago. Soybean requires fertilizer right at the time of sowing. That time has arrived with the monsoon. The fertilizer has not. And it is driving farmers crazy. </p> <p>Fertilizer shortfall in Maharashtra could be as high as 60 per cent. And what fertilizer does arrive becomes the target of profiteering and illegal operations. The runaway price rise adds to this explosive mix. Several regions have seen police lathicharge farmers protesting against the crisis. </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>So why did the fertilizer end up being distributed from the police station? And how do the cops go about it? Inspector Chaudhury admits the procedure is not written into the police manual. \u201cBut it will become our job anyway if there are riots in the marketplace, won\u2019t it,\u201d he asks. \u201cThere was terrific tension in the market. [Some dealers were too scared to open.] There was an imminent threat to law and order. In these troubled situations, where there are so many people gathered, pickpockets and others target poor farmers. Also, what if a stampede broke out? There were vulnerable older people there. I thought it best if we shifted it to the station where we would be in control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was no choice, really,\u201d confirms Arvind Salve (Acting) Superintendent of Police in-charge of Washim. \u201cYou cannot protect every outlet in the market. So it made sense for it to work out of here. And some of the dealers feel safer, too.\u201d One of them, Vinay Biyani of the Vinayak Krishi Kendra, certainly does. \u201cI alone have brought more than 300 metric tonnes of fertilizer to the station yard in the past five days,\u201d he says. The angry farmers grudgingly concede the police are doing a good job of it. \u201cIt was getting too much into the black market,\u201d says a chorus of voices. \u201cAt least here, there is some transparency.\u201d </p> <p>All transactions in the police yard occur under intense public scrutiny. In the marketplace, dealings are more opaque. True, there are also farmers critical of the process but with everybody\u2019s nerves on edge, that seems natural.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just fertilizer, seeds are also in short supply,\u201d say the assembled peasants. Interestingly, many of these farmers have shifted from cotton \u2014 for long the King in Western Vidharbha \u2014 to soybean in just the last few seasons. </p> <p>\u201cThere are no seed problems in Washim,\u201d declares district Agriculture Officer N.V. Deshmukh. \u201cThere are none amongst private dealers,\u201d he says. But it appears that the seed given out under the Prime Minister\u2019s \u201crelief package\u201d has created confusion. </p> <p>Who is entitled to these cheaper seeds? That question becomes more acute as prices rise. \u201cThe more real problem is the fertilizer, but I think that will also be overcome in a while,\u201d says Mr. Deshmukh. However, if the pause in the rains stretches much longer, farmers will have to go in for re-sowing. And there will be no subsidised seed the second time around. They could thus lose up to Rs.2,000 an acre.</p> <p>In Chikhli in Buldhana district next door, the police caned a mob of farmers protesting what they saw as rigging in seed distribution. Here too, the dispute was over 1,600 bags of seed being handed out as part of the Prime Minister\u2019s package. In Pinjar in Akola, seed distribution saw a stampede leave several injured. In Nanded in Marathwada, the police had to intervene after enraged farmers ransacked some shops.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>The State government believes the disruption of rail freight traffic by the Gujjar agitation led to the shortages, with fertilizer piling up at the ports. With the agitation ending, normalcy would return. \u201cWe have solved the problem of fertilizer,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Nanasaheb Patil told the journal <em style=\"i\">AgroOne</em>. \u201cThe Chief Minister himself has spoken to the Prime Minister and [the] Railway Minister asking for more rail wagons to move the held-up fertilizer.\u201d</p> <p>On the ground, others are less sanguine. \u201cThere is the larger issue of a production shortfall and government\u2019s inept planning,\u201d says Kishor Tiwari of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti. \u201cImports will get tougher with global prices four times what they are here. The fuel price hike sends all prices soaring still further. So naturally, there is a demand for the subsidised, cheaper seed. Then there is the exploitation of scarcity. But most top dealers or distributors are well connected politically, the scions of important families, with links to government. Can they be arrested?\u201d </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Mr. Tiwari cites a third reason for the shortages. \u201cDealers backing cotton \u2014 in a region where Bt cotton now reigns supreme \u2014 fear the ongoing shift to soybean. That rapid shift would rob them of their golden goose. Hence the seed and fertilizer shortages target those trying to shift to soybean more than others.\u201d</p> <p>Vidharbha\u2019s leading intellectual on agrarian issues, Vijay Jawandia, agrees. \u201cThe fortune of the input dealers is in Bt cotton seed. There is no benefit for them in the shift to soybean, at least for now.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe immediate crisis might be resolved, but the problem won\u2019t go away,\u201d says Mr. Tiwari. One group of people fervently hoping it will go away are the cops at the Washim police station. Just now, though, they\u2019re too busy to say so. There is still all that fertilizer in their yard to distribute. </p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font

Recession is something that happens in the United States, not here. The word stands exiled from the editorial lexicon. If a rather disastrous situation has somehow to be indicated, the term \u201cdownturn\u201d or \u201cslowdown\u201d will suffice \u2014 and it is to be used with some discretion. But not recession. That would upset the happy buying mood so vital amongst media audiences for the economy to come out of, er, um, well, recession.</p> <p>This don\u2019t-worry-be-happy decree throws up both funny and tragic situations. Several times, the same and other publications in this denial mode sport headlines telling us \u201cthe worst is over and recovery is just around the corner.\u201d The worst of what? Recession? And what are we recovering from anyway? Now many of the publications and channels into this kind of evasion have also been laying off employees in droves, including several journalists. </p> <p>Those poor souls (many with large home loan EMIs contracted when the economy was in even less of a \u201cdownturn\u201d than it is now) are losing their jobs because of \u2014 well, whatever. Imagine you were one of them, working at the desk, filtering copy for your readers to reassure them that all is well. In the evening, you\u2019re exorcising the columns of the ghosts of recession. Next afternoon, you find you are a victim of what you\u2019ve purged. The hypocrisy of the media in acting the opposite of what they tell their audiences is the reality \u2014 gee, that\u2019s part of business strategy. Scare the public and there will be less spending. Which means less advertising, less revenue, less etc.</p> <p>The one time a headline in one of these dailies mentioned the \u2018R word\u2019, it mocked it as in \u201cWhat recession?\u201d More cars were being sold in a particular segment; rural India is shining (the word here is \u201cnew found prosperity\u201d). We need the sunny side up stories \u2014 even as we practise something quite different on the underside. Television channels also trot out the usual (suspect) experts to explain that things are not as bad as they\u2019re made out to be (By whom, we are seldom told). There were happy headlines for a while about declining inflation. (Though a few have lately become cautious about making a production number of this). But there is much less on how serious a problem food prices are. How huge an issue hunger still is. One indication of that does surface in the manifestos of political parties promising rice at Rs. 3 or Rs. 2 or even at Re. 1 a kg. (Oddly, to a population which seems to be set on buying cars, not foodgrain.) But then you know what these manifestos are. </p> <p>So the media speak to their select bunch of certified experts, spokespersons and analysts and declare: there are no issues in this election. There certainly aren\u2019t many the media are talking about. And yes that comes as a relief to political forces enabled to evade some massive problems now unfolding. Even the chance of highlighting the emerging issues \u2014 which would be a big help to many voters \u2014 gets spiked. So we were treated to IPL versus elections, Varun Gandhi, Budiya, Gudiya, and heaps of similar blather. It is to the credit of Jarnail Singh (who gives Barefoot Journalism a whole new meaning) that he got us off the Varun Gandhi trivia and actually scored on an important issue of all elections since 1984,</p> <p>There is a bizarre disconnect between what we report as developments in the United States and what we insist is the reality here. And, of course, there are significant differences \u2014 but we don\u2019t want to explore how those came about. For years, we\u2019ve touted the benefits of one particular form of globalisation. In which the more integrated we were with the world economy (read U.S. and European), the better things got to be. But when things get worse there, it doesn\u2019t affect us. Oh no, not at all.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a measure of the distance, in many ways, between the partygoers and the plebeians. For the latter, there was not much to be gung-ho about, anyway. Many of them would assure you they have issues. But how do we address problems whose existence we barely acknowledged in the first place? So forget about the agrarian crisis, and the 1,82,000 farm suicides associated with it over the past decade. And when was hunger or joblessness an issue (in the media), anyway? Most publications have given zero space to India\u2019s dismal show in the Global Hunger Index. All these are problems that pre-date the meltdown in Wall Street (itself something that, for the media, happened out of the blue, without warning). </p> <p>Over the last year and a half, things have not been so great elsewhere either. The crisis of industry, negative growth in manufacturing, the loss of some jobs in these sectors \u2014 all these do find some mention. Most often, a passing mention. But things get really bad when the Top Ten per cent get spooked. They need to be reassured and must keep buying cars. At some point \u201cnot spooking them\u201d means blurring the lines between illusion, ideology, reality and reporting. It could have very dangerous consequences. </p> <p>For the vast mass of the population, which does not receive stock market updates on cellphones, things were not so bright anyway. The year 2006 is on record in the media as one of our great boom years. But it is the data from that year that place us at 132 in the United Nations Human Development Index. That\u2019s a fall from the already dismal rank of 128 we held \u2014 and places us below Bhutan. In terms of underweight children and malnourishment, India is a disaster zone. Many below us in the index fare a lot better on that front. We have the largest number of such children on the planet. And there are no issues? That the dominant political forces are able to evade the issues does not mean an absence of them. That we are unable to give coherence to the giant processes unfolding around us says more about the media, less about the issues. </p> <p>As their orders run out, export-oriented sectors are in the doldrums. That\u2019s true of Gujarat, Maharashtra and elsewhere. As that happens, lakhs of workers \u2014 migrants from elsewhere \u2014 return to their homes in Orissa, Jharkhand or Bihar. What do they return to? To districts where there is an acute shortage of work \u2014 which is why they left in the first place. To a public distribution system in tatters that could not cater for even the earlier reduced population. To an NREGA that was insufficient to begin with \u2014 and which certainly, at present levels of funding, cannot cope with the addition of lakhs of people.</p> <p>There is a time lag between the onset of the latest phase of recession \u2014 or call it what you will \u2014 and voting in these elections. We go to the polls this month and in May. The job losses amongst migrant workers and others are mounting by the week. You could have a pretty bad situation by the time the monsoon sets in. A few months later, it could be spectacularly bad. But the voting takes place now. Were these polls held some months from today, you would have very decisive results in most States. And the issues would not be Varun, Budiya, Gudiya or Amar Singh\u2019s endless adventures. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there is little in the media that informs our audiences that we are part of the greatest economic crisis the world has seen in 80 years, the worst since the Great Depression. Nothing that prepares readers, listeners and viewers for what could follow. The only slowdown is in the news (and paralysed editorial intellect). The big downturn is in the media\u2019s performance. For the rest of the world it\u2019s a recession. One from which we could move towards far worse. </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\"

Another, a minor contractor in a public works project. A third runs a tiny shop. They\u2019re all pretty rooted in Malkangiri. Not very different from any other small town group. Except that this one consists of a bunch of former Sri Lankan Tamil warriors settled in deep rural Orissa in one of the country\u2019s poorest districts where they\u2019ve been nearly 20 years.</p> <p>Many speak fluent Oriya and Hindi and can converse or understand English well. When they came here in 1990, Tamil was about all they spoke in a land completely alien to them in language, culture and geography. \u201cThey\u2019re more or less locals now, more or less independent, more or less on their own,\u201d says Malkangiri Collector Nitin Bhanudas Jawale. (He is the president of the district cricket association.) Some have married locals and their children go to school here. There were close to a couple of thousand of them when they came here in 1990, belonging to several anti-LTTE Tamil groups. Now there\u2019s less than a hundred left, most of them erstwhile trained fighters of the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF).</p> <p>\u201cWe are glad to be in Orissa,\u201d says S. Prabhakaran, their leader here and a former ENDLF commander. \u201cAnd particularly in Malkangiri. These are a gentle and accommodating people. There are many languages spoken in this town and ours is accepted as one more. We do not feel like strangers. We have more friends here than anywhere else.\u201d This wasn\u2019t always so. </p> <p>In 1993, I stumbled across this group accidentally, intrigued by the sound of Tamil voices in interior Orissa. That too, in this overwhelmingly tribal district. They were in a refugee camp full of awful tin-roofed structures that were beyond endurance in a region where summer temperatures can cross 45{+0} C. Dismal conditions even saw the Tamils stage protest hunger strikes. All in all, they were in a bad state. But how did a bunch of Tamil fighters from Sri Lanka end up in rural Orissa? The withdrawal of the IPKF saw the LTTE decimate the leadership and top cadres of other Tamil groups in Sri Lanka. Many left the war-ravaged nation, including these fighters who were evacuated aboard the vessel Tipu Sultan by Indian forces.</p> <p>They would have landed at Chennai but were denied permission by the then Karunanidhi government. So they were finally off-loaded at Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. After which a generous gesture by then Orissa Chief Minister Biju Patnaik saw them get sanctuary in Malkangiri. Biju Patnaik remains their hero. \u201cHe saved us,\u201d says S. Prabhakaran whose entire family was massacred in the anti-Tamil violence of 1984 in Sri Lanka when he was just 16. </p> <p>The state of their camp was pretty dismal for the first few years. Many dropped out, some of the other groups went back to Lanka after striking deals with Colombo and some left for other places in India. Now there are just about 65 people left here and maybe a few more in other parts of the district. Almost all of them originally from Trincomallee.</p> <p>\u201cWe had problems of food, language and communication. Those days, there were no cell phones. We had to take a bus to go somewhere and find an STD booth. Worst thing was the climate.\u201d Unused to dry heat and often lethal temperatures, cooped into sheds with tin roofs and sides, and getting no more than Rs. 150 a month per person, they had a hard time of it. Nor were they trained to do anything other than fight a war. \u201cAll we could do here was work as labourers,\u201d says S. Bala, now busy in the District Cricket Association. (He is also an active footballer and goalkeeper with a local side). Some also worked as drivers, fruit sellers or petty vendors.</p> <p>Over years, many acquired new skills. Like Sounder Rajan who \u201ccame here when I was 32 and learned carpentry in Malkangiri.\u201d Many of the other fighters were in their teens or early 20s and so have spent almost half their lives here. Bala is now a supervisor at the operations of a local contractor. Others like Yoganathan worked as labourers (he married an Oriya woman and their child goes to an Oriya medium school.) Today, they live in small but decent houses and are fully a part of Malkangiri town. (Some park their cycles and motorcycles in the old sheds they once lived in.) \u201cThey\u2019re really integrated into the community,\u201d says Collector Nitin Jawale. \u201cThey\u2019ve married locals and created livelihoods for themselves.\u201d Some of their children go to school here, some to Bangalore where their leaders have established one for all Sri Lankan Tamil children in India.</p> <p>They\u2019ve even built a small temple here by themselves. \u201cAnd this one could well be the first Ganesh temple in the whole Koraput region,\u201d says Gopi Krishna Patnaik, Malkangiri reporter for the Oriya daily <em style=\"i\">Samaj</em>. \u201cEverybody uses it,\u201d smiles Prabhakaran as he shows us around the temple. \u201cOriyas, Telugus, and others, too.\u201d </p> <p>The once-young fighters are now mostly family men and entrenched in Malkangiri town. A part of them, though, tugs towards another home, another time. They live here happily but find the idea of endless exile upsetting. They were opposed to the LTTE but are obviously very worried about the fate of Tamil civilians in Sri Lanka today. The more so as they see no one standing between their people and the Sri Lankan army. Will they ever think of going back? \u201cWe are here now and we love Malkangiri where everybody, people and officials have been so very good to us. But we will wait for the word of our leader Gnana Rajan (based in Bangalore and Chennai) on what to do. We will do as our leader says.\u201d</p> <p>The way the one-time, once-brash warriors have turned their swords into ploughshares and woven themselves into the community is touching. They are at home here. But, as Prabhakaran says: \u201cyou do dream of the other home. The motherland is always the motherland.\u201d </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2009070455931100.htm&amp;date=2009/07/04/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2009/07/04/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduretailplus.com/\">Retail Plus</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2009070455821000.htm\">Focus on passenger amenities</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009070455831000.htm\">Beyond  short-term fixes</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009070455881000.htm\">Anatomy of homeland and identity politics</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009070455931100.htm\">Turning Tamil swords into Oriya ploughshares</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009070455901100.htm\">Mystery of Scotland\u2019s shrinking sheep solved</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009070455941100.htm\">Corrections and clarifications</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009070455871000.htm\">Condemnable</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009070455871001.htm\">Memorials &amp;

She knows the polling date in her constituency, knows where her voting booth will be, and to some extent follows the ongoing campaign. She articulates her own demands \u2014 and what would be election promises were she a candidate \u2014 with clarity.</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be a BPL Antyodaya card [for poorest of poor] given to people like us. All girl children must get bicycles \u2014 how will they reach school from here? All poor people should get houses under the Indira awaas scheme. And there should be a better old-age pension. Especially in circumstances like ours.\u201d</p> <p>The problem, she feels, is that the election campaigns right now \u201cdo not touch our lives, not at all.\u201d Ramabai, in her 30s, lost her husband Bandu Katkar who, like countless other farmers in Yavatmal district, committed suicide, crushed by debt and the agrarian crisis. There are several thousand women farmers in Vidarbha very much like Ramabai. And well over 100,000 of them nationwide \u2014 devastated when their husbands took their own lives in the ongoing farm crisis. There have been at least 182,936 farmers\u2019 suicides between 1997 and 2007 according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Over 80 per cent of these recorded cases have been male farmers, mostly married and with children.</p> <p>For the women of these farm households, the post-suicide period has often been a descent into abject misery. Quite a few, immediately after the death of their husbands, have been thrown out of their homes by their in-laws. That means fending for themselves and their children without resources. They are also often isolated by the village they live in, which was their husband\u2019s but not their own. \u201cNow,\u201d says one, \u201cwe know and are daily reminded that we are outsiders here.\u201d Several face land grab, sometimes by neighbours, often by their husband\u2019s relatives. Sexual and other harassment begins very soon after the husband\u2019s suicide. There are cases where the unrelenting pressure has seen the woman too, take her own life (sometimes along with those of her children). </p> <p>Yet, the large number of women and children braving immense hardship to stay afloat and live with dignity is inspiring. Many still try to run their farms against all odds, with little or no help from the state. These include women farmers with as many as nine children, including seven girls. They include older survivors in their sixties who work 12-14 hours daily as labourers. That, often at wages less than half the minimum assured by the national rural employment guarantee programme (NREGP). Many do back-breaking labour to be paid only in grain \u2014 no cash. Several have sold land to pay off their husband\u2019s debts. Of those paid some compensation by their governments, many have seen creditors grab most of it. </p> <p>Like most women in her situation, Ramabai farms alone, somewhat isolated in her village of Dahegaon. Like all married woman, the village she lives in is her husband\u2019s village, not her own. \u201cNow,\u201d says one woman farmer, \u201cwe know that we are outsiders here.\u201d Ramabai\u2019s isolation is made worse by the fact that she is a dalit. She faces all kinds of harassment and obstruction in her attempts to farm on the poor-quality 12 acres her husband owned. Six of these have been destroyed by a supposed irrigation project that saw them dug up \u2014 with no benefit to her at all. She has three young children, one of whom has dropped out of school to become an auto driver. There are also her aged parents-in-law to look after. \u201cAnd at best I manage to get two days a week of work as a labourer, for about Rs. 50 a day.\u201d</p> <p>She is willing to engage with politics. Only the presence of her village sarpanch and other males who crowd around prevents her from saying explicitly that she would contest elections, given the chance. </p> <p>No such constraints trouble Anjubai Gokuldas Busari of Pada village nearby. Also in her 30s, she is ready and willing to fight for her rights, \u201cthrough elections or otherwise.\u201d Anjubai has suffered what countless women in this Vidarbha region have. The government has decided that the death of her husband Gokuldas was \u201ca bogus suicide.\u201d That is, it declared that his suicide was not due to agrarian distress. This is an arbitrary and mischief-ridden process that is used to evade responsibility. Once a suicide is so registered, the government is not obliged to compensate the family for the loss of its main breadwinner. </p> <p>\u201cJust look at our condition,\u201d she says in her rickety home atop encroached land. \u201cYet, I must say there are widows who have faced hardships worse than my own.\u201d Anjubai was part of the local SHG \u201cnow paralysed.\u201d She could not repay her loan and others cannot get theirs till she repays. \u201cAt best, I get 7 or 8 days of work in a month as a labourer at Rs. 50 a day.\u201d Her own five acres is under an agreement disadvantageous to her. The man farming there gives her a small share of the crop. \u201cIt should not be this way. But I don\u2019t see our demands being raised in these elections.\u201d</p> <p>Rekha Thag, 36, with a boy and girl still in school, was \u201ctormented by my in-laws in Venikota village last year after my husband took his life. I was kicked out even before his body was taken for the funeral.\u201d Rekha moved to Yavatmal town where she works as a domestic labourer in three households and also supplies \u201cdabba\u201d food to a couple of persons. Her total income: Rs. 1,200 a month. The rent for the tiny room she occupies with her children \u2014 sharing a wall with a noisy godown \u2014 is Rs. 400. She is willing to fight her in-laws for justice. But her approach to the Tehsildar and police have so far proved useless.</p> <p>Rekha too, is willing to engage with the political process \u2014 and even contest the assembly polls months from now, if she gets a chance. Her demands are similar to those of Ramabai. Only, she says with feeling: \u201cOur demands should be for all widows, not just farm widows.\u201d And she wants a monthly pension for all of them fixed at Rs. 1,500. Rekha has suffered twice. In 2001, her father took his own life, another victim of the agrarian crisis. </p> <p>\u201cI think all those of us who have had these experiences have common demands,\u201d she says. In January she attended a convention of women \u201cwidowed by the farm crisis\u201d organised by the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS) in Panderkauda. About 100 such women from just Yavatmal district attended at very short notice. \u201cIt is clear we need to organise,\u201d says Rekha. </p> <p>Rekha Gurnule in Saikheda village is doing relatively better. She has asserted her rights. She has also found a job as an anganwadi worker at Rs.1800 a month. \u201cHe ran away,\u201d she says of her husband who killed himself. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She has a daughter aged 4 and a son aged 5. Rekha has got things under some control. So much so that her in-laws prefer to stay with her rather than with their own, other son. </p> <p>Most of the women farmers who have lost their husbands to the crisis seem to agree on another thing besides political engagement. \u201cWe will not make our children farmers,\u201d says Rekha Thag. \u201cWhat happened with their fathers should not re-happen with them.\u201d </p> <p>Back in Pada, Anjubai says: \u201cI\u2019m ready to fight. Be it elections or anything else. We must have our rights.\u201d Sitting beside us is Kishor Tiwari of the VJAS who has been helping these women farmers. \u201cDo you understand the implications of that?\u201d he asks her. \u201cIt would mean a lot of difficult struggle.\u201d She looks him straight in the eye. \u201cThere are no options for people like me other than struggle. What do you think I\u2019ve done all my life?\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2009041355450800.htm&amp;date=2009/04/13/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2009/04/13/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduretailplus.com/\">Retail Plus</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2009041355440800.htm\">Exorcising 1984</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009041355430800.htm\">Codifying social obligations</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2009041355450800.htm\">Contest elections?

Farmer suicides in the country since 1997 is now 1,82,936.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Yet again, the five worst-affected States \u2014 Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh \u2014 account for two-thirds of all such suicides in the country. Together, they saw 11,026 in 2007. </p> <p>Of these, Maharashtra alone accounted for over 38 per cent. Of the \u201cBig five,\u201d Andhra Pradesh saw a decline of 810 suicides against its 2006 total.</p> <p>Karnataka saw a rise of 415 over the same period. Madhya Pradesh (1,375) posted a decline of 112. But Chhattisgarh\u2019s 1593 means an increase of 110 over 2006.</p> <p>Maharashtra registered a fall of 215. But Karnataka (2,135) and Andhra Pradesh (1,797) \u2014 the next two worst-hit States \u2014 together account for less than Maharashtra\u2019s 4000-plus. </p> <p>A one-year dip of 221 occurred in 2005 in the western State only to be followed by an all-time high of 4,453 suicides in 2006. This trend shows no turn-around and remains dismal.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Maharashtra\u2019s 2007 figure of 4,238 follows one-and-half years of farm \u2018relief packages\u2019 worth around Rs. 5,000 crore and a prime ministerial visit in mid-2006 to the distressed Vidharbha region. </p> <p>Between 2005 and 2007, the State also saw a plethora of official reports, studies, and commissions of inquiry aimed at tackling the problem. </p> <p>However, the 12,617 farmer suicides of these years are the worst-ever for any three-year period since the State began recording such data in 1995. Indeed, farmer suicides in Maharashtra since that year crossed the 40,000-mark. The structural causes of that crisis seem untouched.</p> <p> Nationally, farmer suicides during 2002-2007 were worse than for the years 1997-2001. NCRB data are available for the whole country for 1997-2007. </p> <p>In the five years till 2001, there were 15,747 farmer suicides a year on average. For the six years from 2002, that annual average has risen to 17,366. The increase is distressingly higher in the main crisis States.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font

His fraternity is crucial to the lives of nearly half a million migrants from Ganjam who work in Surat. He may have been an agricultural labourer or small farmer in his origins, but is now part of a tiny elite running an operation worth around Rs. 100 crore a year in this single Orissa district. Meet the \u2018Tappawala,\u2019 Ganjam\u2019s parallel \u2018postman\u2019 or money courier.</p> <p>How do migrants send money home to their families, and how much? \u201cOur conservative estimate is that Ganjam\u2019s migrant labourers remit Rs. 500 crore a year back to their villages\u201d says Lokenath Misra of the NGO Aruna, whose \u201cSethu\u201d project attempts to serve as a bridge between Ganjam migrants and their homes. \u201cOf this, Rs. 400 crore comes from Surat alone. A full picture is not possible as the industry is illegal.\u201d </p> <p>So what does a Tappawala do, anyway?</p> <p>\u201cI spend 15 days in Surat and 15 days here in this Ganjam village each month,\u201d says the Tappawala who has been in the trade for 20 years. \u201cIn Surat, I contact the 200-300 labourers I service and ask them if they would like to send money home. Each sends around Rs. 2,500 a month.\u201d This implies his handling between Rs. 5 lakhs and Rs. 7.5 lakhs a month. But this is for nine months only, since the migrant to Surat normally spends three at home each year. So our Tappawala is handling between Rs. 45 and Rs. 67.5 lakh annually. \u201cWhen in the village, I collect parcels for the migrants in Surat from their families. That includes hot pickles and other foodstuffs.\u201d </p> <p>Does the returning Tappawala carry all that cash on him from Surat? \u201cNot the whole distance. Typically, he would buy a bank draft with that in Surat on a branch in Berhampur (Ganjam\u2019s main town). He would cash that in Berhampur and reach the village by bus or jeep. So he\u2019d really carry cash only for about three hours and 80-100 kilometres.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are about 100 Tappawalas,\u201d says the main one speaking to us. (Tappawalas in other villages confirm his figures.) \u201cOf these 80 are minor to middling, like I was\u201d He insists he is \u2018retired,\u2019 though the respect shown by those around him suggests otherwise. \u201cIn this league, you handle a maximum of Rs. 7.5 lakhs a month.\u201d So 80 of them deal with between Rs. 36 and Rs. 54 crore a year. \u201cThere are about 20-30 big Tappawalas. They move over Rs. 10-15 lakh a month each, some of them much more.\u201d Implying they handle anywhere between Rs.18 crore and Rs. 40 crore a year as a group, or \u201cmuch more.\u201d Remittances \u201cpeak between May and October owing to wedding and festival seasons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut remittances have taken a big hit with the recession,\u201d he says, (using the word recession in English). \u201cOur volumes are badly down.\u201d The collapse of the export sector in urban Gujarat has had hard-to-imagine ramifications in Orissa\u2019s villages. That collapse has seen nearly 50,000 of close to half a million (overwhelmingly male) migrants in Surat, return to Ganjam.</p> <p>Migrant remittances are the mainstay for Ganjam\u2019s roughly 3.5 million people. This has been a high-migration district from British times, particularly after the great famine of 1866. Ganjam labourers have been to myriad destinations, including Burma where some joined Netaji\u2019s Indian National Army during the freedom struggle. Three \u201cBurma Streets\u201d in Berhampore remind us of the link. Today, Ganjam migrants are all over India. A small group even works as plumbers in Ladakh. Nobody knows the total number of migrants from Ganjam, but they could number up to a million. </p> <p>Lokenath Misra of Aruna says: \u201cOn average, Ganjam migrants from all places send in maybe Rs. 10,000 a year, each. We reckon all migrants making remittances send home at least Rs. 500 crore a year to this district, totally. Of this, perhaps Rs. 400 crore comes from Surat from where people send home much higher amounts. But even there, poorer ones who come home only once a year bring their savings with them and do not use the Tappawala.\u201d</p> <p>Some big Tappawalas have prospered enough to be elected Corporators in Surat. Suggesting these individuals are handling much more than the annual average of Rs. 1.35 crore for members of their league. \u201cOur rates are normally Rs. 30 per thousand,\u201d says our Tappawala, who earns around Rs.2.5 lakh a year. \u201cFor that your money gets delivered within 8-15 days. \u2018Next-day delivery\u2019 charges are Rs. 40 per thousand.\u201d</p> <p>Next day delivery? How? \u201cOh, we now have networks of our relatives. Usually urgent transfers involve just a few thousand. So we ring up our relatives here who may withdraw it from the bank and give it to the family.\u201d Sometimes, he adds virtuously, \u201cthe man wanting to send money home may not have any ready, so we advance it \u2014 interest free.\u201d But an interest rate of Rs. 5 per hundred per month \u2014 the standard rate of the local moneylender \u2014 kicks in from the second month. </p> <p>Technology helps. \u201cEarlier, we\u2019d have to physically meet all our contacts in Surat. Today, some one in that group would have a cellphone so enquiries are a lot quicker.\u201d Also, he reveals, \u201ca few of us are using the Internet for money transfer.\u201d He\u2019s cagey about the details of this method but it is mostly about sending an email from Surat to a contact in Berhampur. (Probably an illegal moneylender.)</p> <p>Why should people use him? Why not a bank or post office? \u201cSeveral do use banks, but most of us have never had a bank account,\u201d point out those sitting around the Tappawala. And, he adds, \u201cpeople feel intimidated in a bank.\u201d And the post office? \u201cEven if you are literate, which most migrants are not, you cannot fill out your money order form in Surat in the Oriya language. Getting someone to write it in poor English risks having your money order going astray.\u201d </p> <p>Orissa has recently seen a few postmasters making off with crores of rupees in savings and money orders entrusted to their care by mostly illiterate people. Migrants feel more secure with the Tappawala as his family usually lives in their village or in one nearby. \u201cBut we have a security problem,\u201d says one. \u201cOnce identified, there\u2019s a risk.\u201d Tappawalas have faced lethal attacks on that cash-carrying stretch from Berhampur to Ganjam\u2019s interior villages. Maybe that\u2019s why most of them insist they\u2019ve \u201cretired.\u201d They\u2019re silent about when they did so. But their money talks.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\"

As for jowar, it has almost disappeared. It\u2019s now soybean all the way.\u201d</p> <p>In Washim district, the changeover has already occurred. District Agriculture Officer N.V. Deshmukh says, \u201csoybean cultivation shot up by 80,000 hectares between 2003 and last year when it touched 1.93 lakh hectares. And it might go up more.\u201d In the same period, cotton fell to 59,000 hectares and could decline further.</p> <p>Even in Panderkauda, heart of cotton territory in Yavatmal where the fibre is still King, there could be a regime change this year. The agriculture office says that soybean might just slide past cotton.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Vidharbha is witnessing a historic shift as King Cotton loses ground to soybean. A shift that has major implications for agriculture, livelihoods and the future of the region. \u201cIt began a few seasons ago but has now picked up rapidly,\u201d says Vijay Jawandia, a farmers\u2019 leader and the region\u2019s foremost thinker on agriculture. He says that the price for soybean today is more than double what farmers got just a year or two ago. That is, Rs. 2,600 a quintal against Rs. 1,200. Simply put: soybean is selling at more than twice the minimum support price.</p> <p>The prices have gone up, says Jawandia, because of problems hitting big producers like Argentina amd Brazil. \u201cAnd reduced acreage for it in the United States. That cannot remain the case for long,\u201d he points out. With cotton prices fluctuating over seasons and often declining sharply, lakhs of farmers have been lured by soybean.</p> <p>By end-2004 farmers were getting less than Rs. 1,800 a quintal of cotton on average. That has risen considerably this past year. Mainly because of large acreage shifts to biofuels in the United States. Since Vidharbha\u2019s prices had earlier tanked due to EU-U.S. subsidies to their cotton producers, they rose again with this shift. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to see how long it can remain that way,\u201d says Jawandia. Dismal cotton prices from the late 90s to last year were a major factor in the wave of suicides by indebted farmers. </p> <p>Soybean input costs are far lower. In Washim, Agriculture Department official P.D. Lokhande calculates that \u201cinput costs of soybean are at least Rs. 2,500 less for an acre than those of cotton.\u201d That\u2019s a conservative estimate. Many farmers in Vidharbha run up input costs of over Rs. 13,000 an acre on cotton. Particularly those using Bt and other expensive technologies and chemicals. An acre of soybean can cost half that much to cultivate.</p> <p>\u201cCotton seed costs were even higher two years ago than they are now after government intervention,\u201d says an agriculture department official. \u201cThen, Bt cost Rs. 1,650 a bag of 450 grams. And people often stick to the practice of using two bags an acre even when not needed. Soybean, you can buy the 30 kilograms you need for an acre for Rs. 1,000.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLabour costs are cheaper, too,\u201d says Prabhakar Argude in Lonsawli. \u201cIn cotton you pay for sowing, spraying, five pickings and so on. With soybean it\u2019s for a couple of sprays and then the harvesting. What\u2019s more, soybean matures in four months \u2014 less time than cotton or sugarcane. That allows you to go for a second crop like channa or wheat by October. So all around your returns are higher than with cotton, though your costs with cotton are higher.\u201d </p> <p>Soybean also has less problems with pests, at least for now. \u201cCotton gets more risky each season,\u201d says one agriculture officer. \u201cIt attracts a range of pests that Bt does not even claim to touch. And even the bollworm is gaining in resistance to Bt. Now with the \u2018mealy bug\u2019 showing up, cotton is in trouble. It means more pesticides, more costs, more losses.\u201d</p> <p>Nationally, groups linked to the soybean industry expect the crop to cover up to 10 million hectares in the season that began this month. Up 13 per cent from the previous year. Production by this September could be close to 10 million tonnes across the country. And Maharashtra is the State making the largest shift towards soybean.</p> <p>If the picture in Vidharbha is something to go by, those estimates could well be on track. (Unless the fertilizer shortage derails plans.) Area under soybean in the 11 districts of the region went up by nearly two lakh hectares in 2007 to 17 lakh hectares in one estimate. Even as cotton saw a dip of nearly three lakh hectares, falling to about 14 lakh hectares. It was only in the western districts that cotton retained its fragile hold. This year, soybean seems set to overtake it even there. </p> <p>Across the region, farmers say there\u2019s another reason. \u201cPayments with cotton are a nightmare. You never know when you will receive them.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone is enamoured of the shift to soybean, though. \u201cIt\u2019s not the oil, but the high global price of soybean\u2019s de-oiled cake (DoC) that is driving the frenzy,\u201d says Jawandia. \u201cDoC prices are above Rs. 2,000 a quintal at the global level. (One quintal yields upto 82 kilograms of DoC and 18 kilograms of edible oil.) But what happens when the crop of Argentina and Brazil return to the market? Soybean has its own risks, too. No rains at the time of flowering \u2014 or rains at harvest time \u2014 can cause a wipe-out.\u201d</p> <p>Cotton, on the other hand, says Jawandia, has a better long-term staying power. It is the world\u2019s most important non-food agricultural commodity \u201cand the soil here is ideal for it. Those families using their own labour should stay with cotton. The main draw of soybean is lower labour costs. In non-irrigated land, cotton is the best \u2018employment guarantee scheme\u2019 for the number of days of work it gives.\u201d</p> <p>In Nagpur, a government statistical expert on agriculture is also wary. </p> <p>\u201cThis shift is being driven by poor cotton prices over the past few years. Better cotton prices will see many return to it. Also, soybean is a heavy-feeder crop, drawing much more out of the soil. So successive seasons can see the soil turn \u2018soybean sick.\u2019 In which case, yields will fall. By mid-August, we should know better the extent of change this season.\"</p> <p>Whichever way it goes, the shift is on from cotton to soybean. The region\u2019s farmers could be trading one volatility for another.</p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends

In 1972, you could buy 15 grams of gold with what you earned from producing one quintal of cotton. In Vidarbha, for instance, you made Rs.340 for that quintal (long staple). And gold went at Rs.220 for 10 grams (Rs.330 for 15). True, the cotton growers were even then subsidising rich textile barons in Mumbai. They still do \u2014 a lot more, in fact. But \u2018back then\u2019 seems a lot better right now, relatively speaking. </p> <p>By the 1990s, that trend had been reversed. From the 1970s to mid-1985, cotton was, as Vijay Jawandia calls it, \u201cthe poor man\u2019s cloth.\u201d Man-made fabric was all the rage. By the end of the 1980s, however, a growing bias towards natural fibre saw cotton emerge as the rich man\u2019s cloth. All the big brand names were cashing in on cotton. Yet, cotton farmers in the poorer nations were doing worse. Corporations and traders were doing better. By the mid to late 1990s, obscene subsidies to  cotton growers from the  United States and the  European Union were already pulling the prices downwards. </p> <p>By 2005, you needed to sell five quintals of cotton to buy 15 grams of gold. By early 2008, gold was at Rs.12,125 for 10 grams, cotton at Rs. 2000 a quintal. You now needed to sell nine quintals of cotton to buy 15 grams of gold. The living standards of farmers in cotton-growing regions like Vidarbha had fallen sharply. Cotton prices and incomes were crashing, debt and cultivation costs soaring. The 2004 Lok Sabha polls saw a wave of farmer anger \u2014 and the BSP\u2019s rise \u2014 bludgeon the Congress. The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won 10 of the then 11 seats in Vidarbha.</p> <p>But in the Maharashtra Assembly polls just months later, the Congress did better. It took 30 of the 66 seats from the region. True, Sonia Gandhi\u2019s visit had a huge impact in this traditionally pro-Congress cotton belt. Turning down prime ministership further enhanced the respect she enjoyed there. But the Congress campaign captured voters with a single promise.  It would raise the cotton prices \u2014 then Rs.2200 a quintal \u2014 to Rs.2700. That promise was to be betrayed just months after the polls \u2013 with terrible consequences.</p> <p>In Maharashtra, cotton never received the support that sugarcane did. It was grown in poor regions by dryland farmers with far less political clout than the Pawars of western Maharashtra. As India embraced neo-liberal globalism, that clout waned further. On the one hand, cotton-growers were locked into the volatility of global prices. On the other, input costs were exploding. Local seed cost around Rs.9 a kilogram in 1991. By 2004, commercial seed had taken over and could cost as much as Rs.1,650 to Rs.1,800 for just 450 grams, thanks to Monsanto\u2019s Bt cotton. State intervention later brought the price down to half that. But the damage had been done. And even today\u2019s price of Rs.650-850 for less than half a  kg is still many times higher than Rs.9 a kg. In Maharashtra, the State actively promoted the costly Bt seed, its own agency being a distributor. Huge sums also went to promoting it by using film stars as \u201cbrand ambassadors.\u201d </p> <p>Other inputs, fertilizer, pesticide, utilities like water and electricity, all saw a big rise in costs from the mid to late 1990s. Cotton covers about 5 per cent of cultivable area in India, but accounts for 55 per cent of all pesticides used. (That is in itself a huge problem with alarming long-term consequences for agriculture, environment and health as a whole.) With the massive spread of these, it is no surprise that most farmers taking their lives swallowed chemical pesticides to do so. They are so easy to access, perhaps far more so in this sector.</p> <p>Successive Indian governments did nothing to stop the dumping of subsidised U.S. cotton in this country. There are no duties on import of cotton today. India is the second biggest producer of what is one of the world\u2019s most widely traded commodities. Yet between 1997-98 and 2004-05, we imported 115 lakh bales. That is, over three times the number we did in the preceding 25 years. This cheap imported cotton further devastated growers here. At the same time, like millions of other small farmers, they found bank loans harder and harder to access as rural credit shrank \u2014 by policy. Credit was increasingly diverted towards urban-metro consumption. Many farmers turned to moneylenders, ending up mired in debt.</p> <p>While poor cotton farmers never developed much political and electoral clout, traders and textile barons did. Even if the barons were to pay a slightly better price \u2014 say an additional Rs.2 per metre of raw material went to the farmer \u2014 it would make a difference. It never happened. </p> <p>By 2005, cotton prices collapsed. That\u2019s when the Maharashtra government withdrew the Rs.500 per quintal \u201cadvance bonus\u201d normally tagged on to the minimum support price (MSP) in the State. This saw the price plunging to Rs.1,700 a quintal. (Gold was at Rs.6,180 for ten grams.) Suicides in Vidarbha, already rising, shot up massively. </p> <p>By September 2006, farmers in that region were killing themselves at the rate of one every six hours on average. The Vilasrao Deshmukh government had withdrawn  the advance bonus in 2005 despite appeals from cotton growers, the National Commission for Farmers and many others. The next year, Vidarbha, indeed all of Maharashtra, recorded its worst rise in farm suicides ever. If the Deshmukh government could get away with that, it was because cotton had no strong lobby. Its electoral clout was feeble. </p> <p>Across India, cotton growers make up the largest group of the over 180,000 farmers who committed suicide between 1997 and 2007. The cumulative impact of all these processes was crushing farmers locked into this model of production and into neo-liberal economics. In Vidarbha, for the first time ever, farmers grew more soybean than cotton as losses on the latter were killing them, literally.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing like an election to spur policy change, though. In the run-up year to the polls, the Union government came through with its Rs.71,000 crore loan waiver for indebted farmers. In Maharashtra, the lion\u2019s share of that waiver\u2019s benefits went to just seven of the State\u2019s 35 districts, none of them in the poor cotton-growing regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada. Most of them within the power base of Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar. And all this was about bank debt. Moneylender debt was not touched. Still, there was some relief.</p> <p>The main loan waiver  excluded those owning more than five acres. This penalised some of the poorest farmers. In unirrigated regions, even poor farmers tend to own more acres as productivity is so low. The government did respond to demands that dryland cultivators not be penalised for having more than five acres. After all, polls were now months away. The write-off that followed of Rs.20,000 for such farmers did help a significant group of growers in Vidarbha. And there was also some money that trickled down from even the awfully flawed packages.</p> <p>Then came a healthy rise in cotton prices. The shifting of huge swathes of land in the U.S. to bio-fuel production pushed up prices last year. And a nearly 50 per cent rise in the MSP for cotton took the price to Rs.3,000 per quintal. In Vidarbha, it meant that about seven months of 2008 were the best period the region had seen in years. No basic problem had been resolved, but it brought some relief and reduced the stifling pressure. A pity it took so many deaths \u2014 and election year \u2014 for that to happen.</p> <p>The rise in MSP to Rs.3,000 was also an admission of how disastrous the Deshmukh government\u2019s torpedoing the price to Rs.1700 a quintal had been. And the removal of that Chief Minister also won the region\u2019s approval. </p> <p>To what extent this helps the Congress in these Lok Sabha polls is hard to gauge. There is the BSP factor that is very real and could mess up all bets. (It played a big role in 2004, too. In four seats, the BSP polled far more votes than the margin of defeat of Congress-NCP candidates.) But the Congress faces less hostility than it did three years ago. Whether it can play that to its advantage is another question. And the long-term future of White Gold here is an even bigger one.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font

We kept sitting,\u201d the old freedom fighter told us. \u201cThey threw water on the ground and at us. They tried making the ground wet and difficult to sit on. We remained seated. Then when I went to drink some water and bent down near the tap, they smashed me on the head, fracturing my skull. I had to be rushed to hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Baji Mohammed is one of India\u2019s last living freedom fighters \u2014 just one of four or five nationally recognised ones still alive in Orissa\u2019s Koraput region. He is not talking about British brutality in 1942. (Though he has much to say on that, too.) He\u2019s describing the vicious attack on him during the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, half a century later. \u201cI was there as part of a 100-member peace team.\u201d But the team was given no peace. The old Gandhian fighter, already in his mid-seventies, spent ten days in hospital and a month in a Varanasi ashram recovering from the injury to his head.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>There is not an iota of anger as he describes the event. No hatred towards the RSS or Bajrang Dal that led the attack. Just a gentle old man with a charming smile. And a firm Gandhi bakht. He\u2019s a Muslim who heads the anti-cow slaughter league of Nabrangpur. \u201cAfter the attack, Biju Patnaik came to my home and scolded me. He was worried about my being active even in peaceful protest at my age. Earlier, too, when I did not accept this freedom fighter\u2019s pension for twelve years, he chided me.\u201d</p> <p>Baji Mohammed is a colourful remnant of a dying tribe. Countless rural Indians sacrificed much for India \u2019s freedom. But the generation that led the nation to it is dying out swiftly, most of its members in their late 80s or 90s. Baji is closing in on 90.</p> <p>\u201cI was studying in the 1930s, but did not make it past matric. My guru was Sadashiv Tripathi who later became Orissa Chief Minister. I joined the Congress Party and became president of its Nabrangpur unit [then still a part of Koraput district]. I made 20,000 members for the Congress. This was a region of great ferment. And it came fully alive with satyagraha.\u201d</p> <p>However, while hundreds marched towards Koraput, Baji Mohammed headed elsewhere. \u201cI went to Gandhiji. I had to see him.\u201d And so he \u201ctook a cycle, my friend Lakshman Sahu, no money, and went from here to Raipur.\u201d A distance of 350 km of very tough, mountainous terrain. \u201cFrom there we took a train to Wardha and went on to Sewagram. Many great people were at his ashram. We were awed and worried. When could we meet him, if ever? Ask his secretary Mahadev Desai, people told us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDesai told us to talk to him during his 5 p.m. evening walk. That\u2019s nice, I thought. A leisurely meeting. But the man walked so fast! My run was his walk. Finally, I could no longer keep up and appealed to him: Please stop: I have come all the way from Orissa just to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said testily: \u2018what will you see? I too, am a human being, two hands, two legs, a pair of eyes. Are you a satyagrahi back in Orissa?\u2019 I replied that I had pledged to be one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u2019 said Gandhi. \u2018Jao, lathi khao. (Go and taste the British lathis.) Sacrifice for the nation.\u2019 Seven days later, we returned here to do exactly as he ordered us.\u201d Baji Mohammed offered satyagraha in an anti-war protest outside the Nabrangpur Masjid. It led to \u201csix months in jail and a Rs. 50 fine. Not a small amount those days.\u201d</p> <p> More episodes followed. \u201cOn one occasion, at the jail, people gathered to attack the police. I stepped in and stopped it. \u2018Marenge lekin maarenge nahin,\u2019 I said. (We shall die, but we shall not attack.)\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComing out of jail, I wrote to Gandhi: what now? And his reply came. \u2018Go to jail again.\u2019 So I did. This time for four months. But the third time, they did not arrest us. So I asked Gandhi yet again: now what? And he said: \u2018take the same slogans and move amongst the people.\u2019 So we went 60 km on foot each time with 20-30 people to clusters of villages. Then came the Quit India movement, and things changed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn August 25, 1942, we were all arrested and held. Nineteen people died on the spot in police firing at Paparandi in Nabrangpur. Many died thereafter from their wounds. Over 300 were injured. More than a thousand were jailed in Koraput district. Several were shot or executed. There were over a hundred shaheed (martyrs) in Koraput. Veer Lakhan Nayak [legendary tribal leader who defied the British] was hanged.\u201d</p> <p>Baji\u2019s shoulder was shattered in the violence unleashed against the protesters. \u201cI then spent five years in Koraput jail. There I saw Lakhan Nayak before he was shifted to Berhampore jail. He was in the cell in front of me and I was with him when the hanging order came. What should I tell your family, I asked him. \u2018Tell them I am not worried,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Only sad that I will not live to see the swaraj we fought for.\u2019\u201d Baji himself did. He was released just before Independence Day \u2014 \u201cto walk into a newly free nation.\u201d Many of his colleagues, amongst them future Chief Minister Sadashiv Tripathi, \u201call became MLAs in the 1952 elections, the first in free India.\u201d Baji himself \u201cnever contested the polls. Never married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did not seek power or position,\u201d he explains. \u201cI knew I could serve in other ways. The way Gandhi wanted us to.\u201d He was a staunch Congressman for decades. \u201cBut now I belong to no party,\u201d he says. \u201cI am non-party.\u201d It did not stop him from being active in every cause which he thought mattered to the masses. Right from the time \u201cI took part in the bhoodan movement of Vinoba Bhave in 1956.\u201d He was also supportive of some of Jayaprakash Narayan\u2019s campaigns. \u201cHe stayed here twice in the 1950s.\u201d The Congress asked him to contest elections more than once. \u201cBut me, I was more sewa dal than satta dal. (More service oriented than power seeking.)\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>For freedom fighter Baji Mohammed, meeting Gandhi was \u201cthe greatest reward of my struggle. What more could one ask for?\u201d His eyes mist over as he shows us pictures of himself in one of the Mahatma\u2019s famous protest marches. These are his treasures, having gifted away his 14 acres of land during the bhoodan movement. His favourite moments during the freedom struggle? \u201cEvery one of them. But of course, meeting the Mahatma, hearing his voice. That was the greatest moment of my life. The only regret is that his vision of what we should be as a nation, that is still not realised.\u201d</p> <p>Just a gentle old man with a charming smile. And a sacrifice that sits lightly on ageing shoulders. </p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

The 2002 visit of Congress president Sonia Gandhi to the State both galvanised her demoralised party and brought hope to families destroyed by the agrarian crisis. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu till that moment seen as invincible by even his opponents began to look less so.</p> <p> The highlight of Ms. Gandhi\u2019s visit to the devastated Anantapur district was a meeting where many from suicide-hit families gathered. Each was issued a special \u201cvictim pass\u201d for the event by Congress organisers.</p> <p>Media reports of the time recall the anguish of the Congress president, appalled by what she heard and saw. This was, after all, the State\u2019s worst-hit district in the farm crisis. Hundreds of suicides were being reported each year. Many had been calmly recorded as \u201csuicide due to unbearable stomach ache (<i>kadupu noppi</i>).\u201d Story after painful story poured out. One of the saddest being that of 12-year-old Jayalakshmi Palem. A keen learner, the 7th standard student had\r\n killed herself when faced with  dropping out of school. Her father Laxminarayana, a small farmer in Mamillaguntapalli village, could no longer pay her fees.</p> <p>Other girls, too, had killed themselves under similar circumstances. In some households, the suicide of a father was followed by that of his eldest daughter. Often, the girl blamed herself for her father\u2019s death, feeling he had taken such a step because he had failed to get her married.</p> <p> And countless other households had seen suicides, too. The farm crisis was eating into Anantapur. The Congress president\u2019s meeting was the big moment for the families to be seen and heard. \u201cSonia Gandhi spoke to my mother,\u201d says 12-year-old Somashekar, younger brother of Jayalakshmi, with some pride. He too might well have dropped out of school later on. The visit and the public focus it got ensured he did not.</p> <p>It was also the big moment for local Congressmen to be seen and heard by their leader. To make a good impression and grab that photo-op. This, some of them did by declaring to the media that they were \u201cadopting\u201d those families that had lost their breadwinners. It was, says one officer, \u201ca real Kodak moment.\u201d For the families it proved a fleeting one. Five years on, most have never seen the parents who \u201cadopted\u201d them. Some might-have-been foster parents flatly deny making any such commitments. Others claim they have done their bit and that is enough.</p> <p>Jayalaksmi\u2019s own home is a fractured one. \u201cBoth her parents are across the border in Karnataka, doing coolie work,\u201d says her grandmother P. Mangamma. \u201cTheir four acres are lying fallow.\u201d They had Mangamma leave her own village and move into their house here so that young Somashekar could live on and study in this village.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no option,\u201d she says. \u201cFarming had collapsed. But even that coolie work has since become a huge problem. Laxminarayana had a nasty fall from a height at a construction site when the scaffolding there collapsed. His back was injured and right now only his wife can work.\u201d So the four-member family depends on the daily wage of one woman \u2014 when she can find work, in another State. And on Mangamma\u2019s old age pension of Rs.200. \u201cThey only come back once in two or three months. And most months they can send just Rs.200 or Rs.300 home.\u201d</p> <p>Surely, this was odd. Media reports say the family was \u2018adopted\u2019 during Ms. Gandhi\u2019s visit by Congress MLA J.C. Diwakar Reddy. He is now the State\u2019s Panchayati Raj Minister. Neither Mangamma nor her grandson has any harsh words for the Minister. They\u2019ve just never seen him in their lives. In fact, they haven\u2019t seen any of the local leaders since that meeting.</p> <p>Mr. Reddy remembers it differently. He told <i>The Hindu</i> that he \u201cdid not make any promise to adopt the family.\u201d However, he \u201cstill stands by the commitment\u201d that he did make. Which was, he says, that he would e\r\nducate Somashekar. He is \u201cready to deposit annually, the full amount required for the boy\u2019s expenses towards school fee, books, clothes, and hostel charges.\u201d The school Somashekar goes to charges Rs.2,400 a year as fees for a day scholar. Not a small amount in this poor village.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>This is where it gets curious. The school is not charging the boy any fees. The correspondent of the Sri Vignan T.M. and E.M. school, Mastan, insists, \u201cwe have not taken any money from the boy. As his was a poor family, we did not accept any fees at all.\u201d Well, at least not since Jayalakshmi\u2019s death and Ms. Gandhi\u2019s visit.</p> <p>Mr. Reddy says he  deputed a mandal president and a village sarpanch to meet the family after Ms. Gandhi\u2019s visit and see to the child\u2019s school needs. But, he told <i>The Hindu</i>, \u201cthe family sought cash instead.\u201d\r\n</p> <p> Mr. Reddy said he would rather \u201cdeposit the amount with the head of the institution in the name of boy.\u201d The institution insists it takes no payment at all in this case. And the boy\u2019s family does not claim to be making one. Neighbours say that someone did pay a small amount the first year, after which the school stopped charging its fee. But that was it. \u201cSo where,\u201d asks one villager, \u201cdoes this leave all these \u2018adoptions?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anantapur is not where it was in 2002. The district did receive special attention after the change of government in 2004. On some fronts it has seen distinct improvements.</p> <p> On others, unfulfilled promises and hardship. In this district, there are still those dragged out of school and college by the farm crisis years ago \u2014 and who never went back. That includes the holders of full government scholarships forced to quit to help their families in the fields.</p> <p> Farm suicides are fewer than they were in 2002. But they still happen and could rise again in this fragile region. As elsewhere, agriculture is plagued by uncertainty. Efforts by some groundnut farmers to switch to vegetables, papaya, sweet lemon, and other crops have not quite worked. The next two seasons could prove crucial, says one senior officer.</p> <p> \u201cA lot more depends on the kind of policies we adopt than on the number of children the Ministers adopt.\u201d </p> <p

The State government\u2019s own monthly journal says so. </p> <p>However, the State sees in this, the success of the relief packages of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister for that region. The Maharashtra government\u2019s journal <i>Lokrajya</i> views it as a vindication of ideas going back to t\r\nhe days of \u201cMahatma Jyotiba Phule amd Sant Tukudoji Maharaj.\u201d It goes on to say: \u201cThese great men\u2019s ideas are being translated in the form of the farmers\u2019 packages in Vidharbha. In fact, good results are seen.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBoth those great souls \u2014 among the nation\u2019s foremost reformers \u2014 would have been stunned by the claims being made in their names,\u201d says Mohan Jadhav, secretary of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS). \u201cBoth packages have collapsed months ago. And the cow scheme was the worst part of those. Imagine raising collection by one litre per very costly cow.\u201d</p> <p>The government, though, believes the project has \u201chelped bring back the reign of Bali Raja.\u201d (A sacred king of farmers in folklore, in whose time great prosperity prevailed.) It says 14,221 cows have been given to Vidharbha farmers. (<em style=\"i\">Lokrajya</em> July 2007.) Because of this, \u201cmilk collection there has risen by 37 per cent.\u201d Earlier, it says, \u201cthat averaged 44,600 litres daily in these six districts.\u201d But with the success of the packages, \u201cthere has been an increase of 16,600 litres.\u201d Or 1.16 litres a day per new cow.</p> <p>As a result, says <i>Lokrajya</i>, \u201cthe farmers are flush with cash more regularly. Their daily financial problems could be solved. They do not need to wait for their crops to grow.\u201d </p> <p>Giving quality cows to thousands of poor farmers in the six most troubled districts of the region was a high profile element in the relief packages of both Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The first aimed to bring 40,000 new cows to the region in three years. The second, 18,000 in the same period. Close to two million people in these six districts are officially recorded as living \u201cunder maximum distress.\u201d Another five million are \u201cunder medium distress.\u201d And there have been \u2014 in the State\u2019s own count \u2014 well over 2,000 farm suicides since 2001. (The real figure is much higher.) </p> <p>At the time the \u2018packages\u2019 were announced, the scheme had been attacked as \u201cinsane\u201d by Planning Commission members and farm activists alike. (<i>The</i>\u2002<i>Hindu</i>, July 14, 2006). It gave costly\r\n cows to poor farmers in drought-hit regions without water and fodder. Besides, the beneficiaries had to fork out quite a bit for cows they did not want. (<i>The</i>\u2002<i>Hindu</i>, November 23, 2006). Many complained that the\r\n animals had been forced on them and were eating more than \u201cour entire families.\u201d Kamlabai Gudhe\u2019s cow in Lonsawla village of Wardha district cost Rs.17,500. Of this, she had to pay Rs.5,500 and the government the rest. Within weeks, Kamlabai tried hard to give it away to neighbours who did not want it either. \u201cIt was too costly to feed it,\u201d she says. </p> <p>The 14,221 cows have cost already indebted farmers over Rs.7.5 crore. And that does not include the cost of maintaining them. Which could range from Rs.85 to Rs.150 a day depending on who you are and what you can afford. So maintaining these cows would cost Vidharbha\u2019s bankrupt farmers over Rs.50 crore a year. For 1.16 litres more a day, that is a lot of money. (If fully carried out, the State and Centre will together have spent Rs.165 crore on the scheme in three years.) \u201cThis must be the costliest per litre milk collection rate in the world,\u201d says Mohan Jadhav of the VJAS. </p> <p>\u201cIt takes Rs.45 a day to keep that creature alive,\u201d says Vijay Jawandia, the region\u2019s leading thinker on agriculture. \u201cSo on an increase of one litre, the farmer loses Rs.30 a day in the added cost this cow brings.\u201d Senior officials in Amravati insist that total collection might be much higher. \u201cThey could be selling more to private buyers,\u201d says one. But there are no figures to show this. </p> <p>\u201cIf farmers are doing better with private buyers,\u201d asks Mohan Jadhav, \u201cwhy would they sell these 16,000 litres to government and lose lakhs of rupees each year? Or, if they are getting a better price from government, why would they sell more milk to private parties and lose a fortune?\u201d </p> <p>The State, though, is pleased with the scheme\u2019s progress. Washim district, says <i>Lokrajya</i>, has seen \u201can increase of 328 per cent in milk collection.\u201d Not impressive, since its earlier figure was just 700 litres a da\r\ny. (Now it is 2300 litres daily.) There are single villages in Western Maharashtra that outdo this entire district. Also the \u201c103 per cent increase\u201d in Yavatmal brings its daily collection to 6,100 litres. \u201cThat\u2019s still a fifth of what it was two decades ago,\u201d says Dada Rhode, a leading milk contractor. Also, he says, a lot of milk from Andhra Pradesh is being sold in Yavatmal. So private collection cannot be much better, </p> <p>\u201cPeople do not keep cows because there is no fodder and no water. Nothing in the packages has changed that,\u201d says Mr. Jawandia. \u201cThere was no real promotion of jowar, which would have brought the fodder. In any case, the farmer gets at best Rs.9 per litre of milk on average. Which is Rs.3 less than what a bottle of Bisleri water sells at. When there is no higher income, what sense does it make?\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>The State\u2019s Dairy Development, Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Minister, however, finds that \u201ca transformation has begun.\u201d The impact of these programmes, Anees Ahmed told <i>Lokrajya</i>, \u201ccan be seen in the fact th\r\nat in the last few days the number of suicides has reduced.\u201d (Shortly thereafter, Vidharbha saw 28 of them in a week.)</p> <p>The cow programme, though, will not suffer. The Minister promises the State will increase the money it spends per cow to Rs.20,000. \u201cIn that way, the financial burden (on the farmer) will be reduced.\u201d What\u2019s more, \u201cin order to increase their [farmers\u2019] awareness, we are going to have Chetna Dindis.\u201d (That is, awareness or consciousness-raising rallies and campaigns.) Vidharbha\u2019s march to progress is unstoppable.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p>

You can see how dark it gets in here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn here\u201d is a space not much more than nine feet by eight feet and home to two looms, Krishnamma and her two children. The looms, which take up most of the room, were installed there by merchants who have left the raw material with her and who will collect the product when it is ready. Beautiful woven sarees that Krishnamma and her daughter Amita are unlikely to ever wear. They will get Rs.600 per saree they finish. With son Pulanna pitching in as well, they can \u201cmake up to two in a month. That\u2019s how much work we get just now.\u201d And they do it to an unpredictable schedule, marked by blackouts, breakdowns, and occasional bouts of electricity. That\u2019s life in Subrayanapalli village in Anantapur district.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, when the current does come, we have to work no matter what time it is,\u201d Krishnamma explains. And she has to do it while helping the young ones on the other loom. That\u2019s besides doing the washing, cleaning, and cooking. Sometimes she gets other work but her labour fetches no more than Rs.25 a day. \u201cSome weaving, I learned as a girl,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, her legs are swollen with standing so many hours at the loom and also trying to make the work lighter and easier for the children. Both have dropped out from school. Pulanna at 14 from a school four km away. And Amita, 15, who misses school deeply but won\u2019t admit it because of loyalty to her mother.</p> <p>Krishnamma is one of more than a lakh of women who have lost their husbands to farm suicides across the country in the past 14 years. Anantapur was one of the worst-hit districts in the flood of farmers\u2019 suicides. Her husband Nethi Sreenivasulu hanged himself in 2005 after all the four borewells he set up on his three-and-a-half acres at a cost of Rs.60,000, failed. \u201cThe creditors have come and asked me to pay up,\u201d says Krishnamma. \u201cI could not. Where\u2019s the money?\u201d There\u2019s none from the government, for sure. \u201cNo, I never got any compensation after his death,\u201d she says. Krishnamma has no faith in agriculture. \u201cWe have lost too much, too many years.\u201d She\u2019s too busy for regret or recrimination anyway. There\u2019s a family to be fed and she will do that at any cost to herself.</p> <p>In Chinna Mushtiuru, Parvati Mallappa has begun setting up her tailoring school. This extraordinary woman counselled her husband against suicide in 2003. She pointed out to him that the whole village was in the same state of debt and despair and urged him not to give in to creditor pressure. Duggala Mallappa killed himself anyway. Parvati decided not to go back to her mother\u2019s village in Bellary, Karnataka. She stayed on, determined to educate her three daughters Bindu, Vidya, and Divya who are just four, seven, and nine years old now. Parvati herself is one of the most educated women in her village, having passed her 10th class.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>She leased out their 12 acres for a pittance and decided to teach herself tailoring. \u201cI did some sewing as a child,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt I could make this work.\u201d She did. It has been almost like serf labour and she needed to pay off Mallappa\u2019s debts as well. That too, she did, using some of the compensation money she got, and selling off their cattle and other assets. All the while living alone with three very young girls she has to protect and raise. The two older girls are doing well at school. One recently scored 49 on 50 in a science test. And educating them to \u201cany level they want to go\u201d is Parvati\u2019s goal.</p> <p>Why tailoring? She\u2019s studied her village and worked it out. \u201cWe have some 800 families around here. Almost everyone has a girl. So while it is true that I make very little money from the stitching work I get, it is also true that there is scope for teaching sewing here. Even if ten per cent of those families want their girls to learn sewing, I will have more students than I can handle.\u201d And so, with some help, she\u2019s equipped herself with two more sewing machines and is all set to launch her \u201cschool.\u201d She says \u201cI can get more work done when these girls are away at school. Once they\u2019re home, it gets chaotic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer courage is amazing,\u201d says Malla Reddy, Director of the Ecology Centre of the Rural Development Trust in Anantapur. A body he is associated with is helping with the girls\u2019 education. \u201cTo stay there alone with three little girls and face up to the challenges is not easy. But she\u2019s done it. She has a clear-headed view of her tasks. And she sees her future in the children. They are her motivation.\u201d</p> <p>The same district has hundreds of Parvatis and Krishnammas, for whom the odds have proved too much. Several have sold off land and cattle to pay debts, but are still not clear of them. Many have seen their children drop out of school. Many more are doing back-breaking labour, often for less than what they would earn if they found work on the National Rural Employment Guarantee programme. Like their counterparts in other regions hit by the agrarian crisis, these suicide-hit households see growing hunger and hardship. Some have seen a second suicide driven by the same distress that caused the first. More than 100,000 of them nationwide still fight for survival so that the next generation might do better. As Parvati Mallappa puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s all for the children, sir. Our time has gone.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<web></web></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

They even included a privileged Parking Pass for her car. But Laxmi did not bother to reply. Nor did she make it to their Independence Day event either. </p> <p>Laxmi Panda has no car and lives in a tiny room in a chawl in Jeypore town of Koraput district. An improvement on the ugly slum where she has spent most of two decades. Last year, she did make it to the I-Day event since local well-wishers bought her train ticket. This year, she can\u2019t afford it. She laughs as she shows us the invitation and the parking pass. The only connection she has ever had to a car: \u201cMy late husband was a driver four decades ago.\u201d This Indian National Army (INA) fighter still proudly holds on to a published photo of herself, with rifle in hand</p> <p>Laxmi is one of countless rural Indians who fought for the country\u2019s freedom. Ordinary people who did not go on to become famous as leaders, Ministers or Governors. Just people who sacrificed a great deal and then went back to everyday lives after Independence. Most of that generation has died out as the nation celebrates its 60th anniversary. The few who remain are in their late 80s or 90s and many are ailing or otherwise in distress. (Laxmi herself is an exception to the age group. She joined the INA in her early teens, and is only now closing in on 80.) The number of freedom fighters is dwindling rapidly.</p> <p>Orissa State recognises Laxmi Panda as a freedom fighter, which entitles her to a meagre monthly pension of Rs.700. This went up by Rs.300 last year. Though for many years, no one knew where to send her the money. However, freedom fighter status has been denied to her at the Centre despite several INA legends of that time corroborating her claims. \u201cThey said in Delhi I haven\u2019t been in jail,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s true, I haven\u2019t. But then many fighters of the INA did not go to jail. Does that mean we didn\u2019t fight for freedom? Why should I lie for my pension?\u201d</p> <p>Laxmi was one of the youngest members of Netaji Bose\u2019s Indian National Army. Perhaps the only Oriya woman to have enlisted with the INA and joined its camp in Burma. Certainly the only one living. She says Bose personally gave her the new name of Indira, to avoid confusing her with the far more famous Laxmi (Captain Laxmi Sehgal) at that time. \u201c\u2018In this camp,\u2019 he told me \u2018You are Indira.\u2019 I was too young to understand much. But from then on, I was Indira.\u201d </p> <p>Laxmi\u2019s parents were killed in a British bombing sortie while working in the railways in Burma. After that \u201cI wanted to fight the British. My senior Oriya friends in the INA were most reluctant to involve me in anything. They said I was too young. I begged to join in whatever capacity, even a menial one. My brother Nakul Rath was also a member and he disappeared in the war. Years later, someone told me he had come out and joined the Indian army and was in Kashmir, but how could I even check? Anyway, that was half a century ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the camp I met Lt. Janaki, and saw the likes of Laxmi Sehgal, Gowri and other famous INA fighters,\u201d she says. \u201cWe went to Singapore in the later part of the war,\u201d she recalls, \u201cWith, I think, the Bahadur Group.\u201d There she stayed with Tamil sympathisers of the INA and even picked up a few words of the language. She signs her name Indira in Tamil in front of us, to prove her point. And proudly sings the first verse of the INA anthem: \u201cKadam kadam badhaye jaa, khushi ke geet gaye jaa. Yeh zindagi hai kaum ki, tu Kaum pe lutaye jaa.\u201d (\u201cStep by step we march forward. And sing the songs of happiness. This life belongs to the community, so for the community sacrifice yourself.\u201d) </p> <p>Of her photo in INA uniform, with a rifle, she says it was \u201ctaken after the war, at a reunion and when we were disbanding.\u201d Soon, \u201cI married Kageshwar Panda in 1951 in Berhampur and a lot of Oriya INA members came for my wedding.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>She is nostalgic about her old INA comrades. \u201cI miss them. Even the ones I did not know well, I wish I could see them again. You know, once I heard that Laxmi Sehgal was speaking at Cuttack, but I could not afford to go. I wish I could have seen her just once at least.\u201d The only chance I ever had of going to Kanpur \u2014 I fell ill at that time. Now where will there ever be a chance?\u201d</p> <p>In the 1950s, her husband got a driver\u2019s licence \u201cand we worked for some years near Hirakud. At that time, I was happy and I did not have to labour for a living myself. But he died in 1976 and my troubles began.\u201d</p> <p> She worked variously as a store helper, a labourer, and as a domestic servant. Always for a pittance. Saddled with an alcoholic son who had several children, all in bad shape.</p> <p>\u201cI asked for nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI fought for my country, not for reward. I sought nothing for my family either. But now, at the end of this chapter, I hope at least my contribution will be recognised.\u201d </p> <p>Ill health and poverty combined to crush her a few years ago. That\u2019s when a young journalist of Jeypore, Paresh Rath, broke the story. Rath also moved her from the slum to her single room residence at his own expense and looked after her medical needs. Panda was recently hospitalised following an illness. She is at her son\u2019s place for now, despite her misgivings about his habits. Other stories followed Rath\u2019s. And she once even made it to the cover of a national magazine.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we did the first story, she did get some help,\u201d says Rath. \u201cThe then Collector of Koraput, Usha Padhee, was sympathetic. She got Laxmi Rs.10,000 from the Red Cross Fund as medical aid. And also assured her a piece of government land. But Padhee left the district on transfer. Some people in Bengal also sent her some donations.\u201d However, this soon died down and she was back to square one. \u201cAnd yet it is not just a matter of money,\u201d points out Rath. \u201cEven if she gets the Central pension, how many years will she enjoy it? It is really a matter of pride and honour for her. But the Central government has simply not responded.\u201d</p> <p>After many frustrating attempts, Laxmi was allotted a piece of government land at Panjiaguda village in this district late last year. But she still waits and hopes for a house on it under a government scheme. For the present, Rath has funded the making of a better room adjacent to her old one and hopes to move her into it soon. </p> <p>She has a little local recognition now. A few organisations have come forward to press her case. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she told me on August 14, \u201cI will hoist the flag at the Deepti School here. They asked me to.\u201d She is proud of that, but worries she does not have a \u201cproper saree to wear to the function.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the ageing INA soldier plans her next battle. \u201cNetaji said \u2018Dilli Chalo.\u2019 That\u2019s what I will do after August 15 if the Centre does not recognise me as a freedom fighter by then. I will sit down in a dharna at Parliament,\u201d says the old lady. \u201cDilli chalo, that\u2019s what I will do.\u201d</p> <p>And so she will, maybe some six decades late. But with hope in her heart. As she sings, \u201ckadam, kadam, badhaye jaa \u2026\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2007081554621300.htm&amp;date=2007/08/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2007/08/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2007081554571200.htm\">The spreading contagion</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007081554561200.htm\">Italy\u2019s economic slowdown</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007081554591200.htm\">Autonomy for the States, federalism at the Centre</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007081554611300.htm\">Is rising India a just society?

Yet, as P. Sainath, <em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em>\u2019s Magsaysay Award-winning Rural Affairs Editor, has informed us in his brilliant articles\r\n and outstanding speeches, this is the same India which has the world\u2019s fourth largest number of dollar billionaires, whose combined wealth makes the India of today (forget tomorrow!) the second major economic superpower in the global economy of billionaires. According to Sainath, we fare rather worse when it comes to dollar millionaires, our global ranking falling to eighth. But when we drop below arabpatis, crorepatis and lakhpatis to the aam admi, Sainath finds that the phenomenal spurt in GDP growth rates in recent years, which will see us breaking the magic 10 per cent barrier this year, has raised the aam admi on the UN Human Development Index from 127th position all the way to the 126th position. So, around 20 crore (200 million) Indians go to bed hungry every night. This is injustice indeed.</p> <p>More disturbing still, Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, in his May 2007 lecture to the Bureau of Parliamentary Studies, pointed out that over the period of the first six Five-Year Plans \u2014 a stretch of about 35 years, given Plan holidays (as they were somewhat archly called) \u2014 the rate of growth of agricultural production consistently exceeded the rate of growth of GDP. Of course, we are talking here of the \u2018Hindu rate of growth.\u2019 Indeed, when during the 1980s the country first jumped from the \u2018Hindu\u2019 rate of growth to the new trajectory of 5.6 per cent annual average, agriculture still beat GDP by growing at 5.7 per cent. Thus, in the first 45 years or so of Independence, the first beneficiary of growth \u2014 high and low \u2014 was the kisan and the khet mazdoor. How significant this was for them might be gauged from the fact that they constituted between two-thirds and four-fifths of our population. The iconic status of Jawaharlal Nehru, now sneered at by our middle class and their spokespersons in the media, is fundamentally explained by the aam admi in Nehru\u2019s era having shot up from near stagnation to at least the \u2018Hindu\u2019 rate of growth. (For remember, the annual average rate of growth of India under the British in the first half of the 20th century was a mere 0.72 per cent). And the major governance reforms of the Nehru era \u2014 the integration of the princely states, land reforms (however halting and partial), tenurial reforms, the A.D. Gorwalla Committee on reforms in the cooperative sector, and S.K. Dey\u2019s Community Development, but, above all, the Balwantrai Mehta Study Group on Panchayati Raj \u2014 all were aimed directly at the poorest and most needy. In consequence, the growth of that abstraction called \u2018the economy\u2019 might have been sluggish but the exponential rise in the welfare of the poor was spectacular.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>The other spectacular consequence of Nehruvian socialism was the burgeoning of the middle class. The middle class has now outstripped its requirement of socialism (hence the vulgar kicking of the ladder up which it rose). But for those 836 million Indians surviving on under Rs.20 a day even six decades after Independence, the only hope of survival is the state. But not \u2014 above all, NOT \u2014 the state intervening through an indifferent bureaucracy but a state reaching the people through the intermediation of elected panchayats. Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s constitutional amendments have given us 2.5 lakh elected institutions of local government at the grassroots in both rural and urban India. To these, We the People of India (the rural people, not the beautiful people managing the Commonwealth Games) have elected 32 lakh democratic representatives, responsive and responsible to those underprivileged 836 million Indians in their gram sabhas. Meanwhile, accelerated growth through economic reforms has given the Finance Ministry the wherewithal to channel the stupendous sum of Rs.81,000 crore to rural development and rural welfare. But if even that gigantic sum of money has raised us only from 127th to 126th position on the U.N. Human Development Index, it is because the state still relies too heavily on the bureaucracy and, almost everywhere, is yet to genuinely empower the panchayats and nagarpalikas through the effective devolution of functions, finances, and functionaries. The 2000-page, three-volume report on The State of the Panchayats \u2014 A Midterm Review and Appraisal which I tabled in Parliament last November is proof of both the enormous strides we have made in the last three years towards meaningful Panchayati Raj and of the long road we are yet to traverse.</p> <p>Therefore, to make ours a truly just society, my plea is that we ally economic reforms to governance reforms through the panchayats so as to translate accelerated growth into \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 \u2014 the overarching objective of the Eleventh Five Year Plan. Let us, therefore, dedicate ourselves, at this commencement of the seventh decade of our Independence, to the greatest dream of the greatest Indian \u2014 the Mahatma\u2019s dream of Panchayati Raj \u2014 for that would be the true symbol of our having accepted his talisman of summoning to our minds when in doubt the poorest man we know and asking ourselves whether the step we propose to take will be of benefit to him for then, as Gandhiji said, our doubts will vanish and we will know the right path to take.</p> <p>\r\n<i>(The writer is Union Minister of Panchayati Raj.)</i>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2007081554611300.htm&amp;date=2007/08/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2007/08/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2007081554571200.htm\">The spreading contagion</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007081554561200.htm\">Italy\u2019s economic slowdown</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007081554591200.htm\">Autonomy for the States, federalism at the Centre</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007081554611300.htm\">Is rising India a just society?

In 60 years we haven\u2019t managed \u2014 except in three States \u2014 to push through any serious land reforms or tenancy reforms. But we can clear a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in six months. In the sixth decade of our independence, structural and other inequalities deepen, and rural India is in big trouble</p> <p>The first lead story on the front page of a major English daily four weeks ago was striking. A young man from Chandigarh had paid Rs.15 lakh for a \u2018fancy\u2019cellphone number. It wasn\u2019t long before the rest of the media got into the act. Soon we saw his parents distributing sweets to mark their son\u2019s achievement. Newspapers editorialised (in front page \u2018news reports\u2019) on how this reflected India\u2019s new confidence. Our \u2018aggro\u2019 in the period of economic reforms and liberalisation. </p> <p>It surely reflects something. A class exists to whom it is perfectly natural for a leading Indian magazine to act as luxury scout. Its publisher\u2019s letter tells them that \u201cfor $115,000 a box, 500 limited edition Dragon Gurkha cigars are now available. In 80 year old camelbone boxes that once belonged to a Rajasthani ruler.\u201d</p> <p>The average monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) of the Indian farm household is a long way from Rs.15 lakh. And further from $115,000. It is, in fact, Rs.503. Not far above the rural poverty line. And that\u2019s a national average, mixing both giant landlords and tiny landholders. It also includes States like Kerala where the average is nearly twice the national one. Remove Kerala and Punjab and the figure gets still more dismal. Of course, inequality is rife in urban India too. And growing. But the contrasts get more glaring when you look at rural India. </p> <p>About 60 per cent of that Rs.503 is spent on food. Another 18 per cent on fuel, clothing, and footwear. Of the pathetic sum left over, the household spends on health twice what it does on education. That is Rs.34 and Rs.17. It seems unlikely that buying unique cellphone numbers is set to emerge a major hobby amongst rural Indians. There are countless households for whom that figure is not Rs.503, but Rs.225. There are whole States whose average falls below the poverty line. As for the landless, their hardships are appalling.</p> <p>It is not that inequality is new or unknown to us. What makes the last 15 years different is the ruthlessness with which it has been engineered. The cynicism with which it has been constructed. And the scale on which it now exists. And that\u2019s at all levels, even at the top. As Abhijit Banerjee and Thomas Piketty put it in a paper on \u201cTop Indian Incomes 1956-2000,\u201d \u201cThe rich (the top 1 per cent) substantially increased their share of total income [in the reform years]. However, while in the 1980s the gains were shared by everyone in the top percentile, in the 1990s it was only those in the top 0.1 per cent who made big gains.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe average top 0.01 per cent income was about 150-200 times larger than the average income of the entire population during the 1950s. This went down to less than 50 times as large by the early 1980s. But went back to being 150-200 times larger during the late 1990s.\u201d All the evidence suggests it has gotten worse since then. </p> <p>Industry\u2019s hostile response to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s meek comments on CEO salaries is just a sign of how entrenched such privilege now is. The editorials of most newspapers blew Dr. Singh out of the water. So it is odd and worth noting, that one of the very best pieces on concentration of wealth in recent times comes from the Executive Director of Morgan Stanley. (<i>The Economic Times</i>, July 9, 2007). \u201cWe believe,\u201d writes Chetan Ahya, \u201cthat the \r\nsocial pressure arising from widening inequality has increased in the past few years, driven by globalisation and the rise of capitalism.\u201d He finds the \u201crising social challenge on account of the rise in inequality\u201d a worrying trend. He also finds that \u201cthe inequality gap in wealth is even starker \u2026 Our analysis indicate an increase in wealth of over $1 trillion (over 100 per cent of GDP) in the past four years \u2014 and that the bulk of this gain has been concentrated within a very small segment of the population.\u201d Mr. Ahya rightly sees \u201csocial and political upheaval,\u201d as the outcome of some directions we are taking. As in the case of farmers and SEZs.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>All this comes atop existing structural inequalities in rural India. In 60 years, we never resolved the issue of land. Nor those of forests and water rights. Or of appalling levels of caste and gender discrimination. We never really addressed our structural or other inequalities. Now we\u2019re working hard at making them worse. </p> <p>Even at the start of the reforms period, the bottom half of rural households accounted for less than 3.5 per cent of total land ownership. The top ten per cent of households owned well over 50 per cent. That\u2019s for all lands as a whole. If we took into account only irrigated land, the picture is more frightening. Add productive assets, and it gets still worse. In one estimate, over 85 per cent of rural households are either landless, sub-marginal, marginal or small farmers. Nothing has happened in 15 years that has changed that situation for the better. Much has happened to make it a lot worse. </p> <p>The direction of policy on farming \u2014 central to rural India \u2014 is simple in its main idea. To take agriculture out of the hands of farmers and place it firmly in the hands of large corporations. Every move, every policy, only pushes this idea further forward. We are witnessing the largest displacement in our history. It is not happening in a dam or a mining project. It\u2019s happening in agriculture. And we haven\u2019t a clue yet what we will do with the millions we\u2019re busy shoving off the land. This is not being done with tanks and bulldozers. We just make farming impossible for small holders. And we create no options for those whose livelihoods we so cheerfully destroy. </p> <p>The early decades were at least decades of hope. There were improvements, significant if not impressive. In literacy, life expectancy, and other human development indicators. There was a sense that \u201cIndia lives in her villages.\u201d The slogan that caught the nation\u2019s imagination, even if in wartime, was \u2018jai jawan, jai kisan.\u2019 The farmer was seen as carrying the nation\u2019s future on his or her shoulders. (More normally \u2018his\u2019 since women are to this day denied property rights and not seen as \u2018farmers.\u2019) At least, that was the image.</p> <p>Sixty years on, rural India is a shambles. The most severe agrarian crisis since the eve of the Green Revolution rages on, but does not hold elite or media interest for long. Farm incomes have collapsed. Hunger has grown very fast. Public investment in agriculture shrank to nothing a long time ago. Employment has collapsed. Non-farm employment has stagnated. (Only the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act has brought some limited relief in recent times.) Millions move towards towns and cities where, too, there are few jobs to be found. Many move towards a status that is neither farmer nor worker. A huge pool of menial labour or domestic servants. (In one estimate, there are close to two lakh girls from Jharkhand in Delhi alone, in work of this kind.)</p> <p>A credit squeeze has pushed lakhs of farmers into bankruptcy. This after encouraging, even pushing them towards high-cost cash crop cultivation with its attendant risks. In Kerala of 2003-04, raising an acre of vanilla cost 15 to 20 times what it took to raise an acre of paddy. But farmers were asked to rush in regardless. The price of vanilla has sunk and the credit flow has stopped. And several such growers have taken their own lives. </p> <p>We fail to invoke even those measures the blatantly unfair WTO allows us; this means the prices our own farmers get for products like cotton collapses by the season. The huge subsidies attached to U.S. cotton \u2014 over a million bales dumped on this country in just 2001-02 \u2014 are not challenged. Duties are not raised. We\u2019re glad to trade the interests of our poor for another 30,000 H1B visas.</p> <p>The government tells us over 112,000 farmers have committed suicide since 1993. A gross underestimate but the figure is bad enough. These are suicides driven by debt. And the indebtedness of the peasantry, so the National Sample Survey tells us, has almost doubled in the past decade.</p> <p>It is not as if there is no resistance, no voices raised. The people have spoken to their governments and all of us in election after election. In protest after protest. And good things, too, have happened. Like the NREGA. But the larger direction is overwhelming. And it is one that races towards catastrophe, disaster having already been achieved. We, however, are more interested in the cellphone number worth Rs.15 lakh. And maybe there\u2019s a point in that. The \u2018fancy\u2019 number was purchased on borrowed money. Our orgy in inequality plays out on borrowed time.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p>

Sainath, Rural Affairs Editor of The\u2002Hindu, spoke of the legacy bequeathed to Indian journalism by freedom fighters who doubled up as journalists, and said he w\r\nas accepting the award on behalf of the same tradition of giving voice to the voiceless.\r\n</i></p> <p>\r\n<i>Mr. Sainath won the award in the Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication category for his \u201cpassionate commitment as a journalist to restore the rural poor to India\u2019s national consciouness.\u201d</i>\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<i>This is the text of the speech:</i>\r\n</p> <p>This is the 60th year of Indian independence. A freedom fought for and won on a vision that placed our humblest citizens at the centre of action and of the future. A struggle that brought the world\u2019s then mightiest empire to its knees. A struggle which saw the birth of a new nation, with a populace overwhelmingly illiterate, yet aiming at and committed to building a democracy the world could be proud of. A people who, one freedom fighter predicted, would make the deaf hear and the blind see. They did.</p> <p>Today, the generation of Indians who took part in that great struggle have mostly died out, though their achievements have not. The few who remain are in their late 80s or 90s. As one of them told me recently: \u201cWe fought to expel the colonial ruler, but not only for that. We fought for a just and honourable nation, for a good society.\u201d</p> <p> I am now recording the lives of these last stalwarts of a generation I was not part of, but which I so deeply admire. A struggle that preceded my birth, but in which my own values are rooted. In their names, with those principles, and for their selflessness, I accept this great award.</p> <p>In that great battle for freedom, a tiny press played a mighty role. So vital did it become, that every national leader worth his or her salt, across the political spectrum, also doubled up as a journalist. Small and vulnerable as they were, the journalists of that time also sought to give voice to the voiceless and speak for those who could not. Their rewards were banning, imprisonment, exile and worse. But they bequeathed to Indian journalism a legacy I am proud of and on behalf of which tradition, I accept this award today.</p> <p>For the vision that generation stood for, the values it embodied, are no longer so secure as they once were. A nation founded on principles of egalitarianism embedded in its Constitution, now witnesses the growth of inequality on a scale not seen since the days of the Colonial Raj. A nation that ranks fourth in the world\u2019s list of dollar billionaires, ranks 126th in human development. A crisis in the countryside has seen agriculture \u2014 on which close to 60 per cent of the population, or over 600 million people, depend \u2014 descend into the doldrums. It has seen rural employment crash. It has driven hundreds of thousands from villages towards towns and cities in search of jobs that are not there. It has pushed millions deeper into debt and has seen, according to the government itself, over 112,000 farmers take their own lives in distress in a decade.</p> <p>This time around, though, the response of a media politically free but chained by profit, has not been anywhere as inspiring. Front pages and prime time are the turf of film stars, fashion shows and the entrenched privilege of the elite. Rural India, where the greatest battles of our freedom were fought, is pretty low down in the media\u2019s priority list. There are, as always, exceptions. The paper I work for, <i>The\u2002Hindu</i>, has consistently given space to the chronicling of o\r\nur greatest agrarian crisis since the eve of the Green Revolution. And across the country are countless journalists who, despite active discouragement from their managements, seek to place people above profit in their reporting. Who try desperately to warn their audiences of what is going on at the bottom end of the spectrum and the dangers to democracy that this involves. On behalf of all of them, all these colleagues of mine, I accept this award.</p> <p>In nearly 14 years of reporting India\u2019s villages full time, I have felt honoured and humbled by the generosity of some of the poorest people in the world. People who constantly bring home to you the Mahatma\u2019s great line: \u2018Live simply, that others might simply live.\u2019 But a people we today sideline and marginalise in the path of development we now pursue. A people in distress, even despair, who still manage to awe me with their human and humane values. On their behalf too, I accept the Ramon Magsaysay award. </p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

Killing themselves in large numbers only proves how lazy they are.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\nIn the good old days, a Minister or Governor getting out of something he had said simply denied it. \u201cI was misquoted.\u201d Or it was \u201ca total fabrication.\u201d Television complicates things. Cures for foot-in-the mouth-disease get messy when you\u2019ve goofed up on camera. The ruling etiquette now is: \u201cMy words were taken out of context.\u201d Only, we are seldom told what that \u201ccontext\u201d is. </p> <p>And so it was in  Maharashtra this week. First, Union Textiles Minister Shankersinh Vaghela appeared to be fighting the coming Gujarat elections in Maharashtra. That too, at a meeting of the Cotton Brokers\u2019 Association in Akola district. He extolled the farmers of his home State and batted for Gujarati pride. Which is fine. His own people, both farmers and non-farmers, are very hard-working. But then he added that the problem with farmers in Maharashtra was that they \u201cjust sit around and don\u2019t go to their farms.\u201d He wanted them to learn about hard work from his own State. \u201cYou must emulate the farmers of Gujarat. Come there and see for yourselves,\u201d he said. </p> <p>That these homilies were delivered in Vidharbha \u2014 a region seeing countless farm suicides \u2014 was bad enough. But there was more to follow. The guardian of the destinies of 100 million people in  Maharashtra took the mike and rubbed it in. \u201cThere is some truth in what he has hinted \u2026 we must keep it in mind,\u201d said  Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.</p> <p>And then \u2014 in a shot at humour \u2014 \u201cOur farmers here, too, are \u2018innovative.\u2019 They sprinkle water on cotton, add stones to it, to increase the weight of their yield when they bring it to market.\u201d And still more: \u201cA farmer here is also innovative in increasing his cotton sowing area on paper, to seek government aid. Vidharbha farmers don\u2019t lag behind in innovation.\u201d </p> <p>The Chief Minister has since said his words were taken out of context. Which sort of obliges him to explain \u2014 what was the context? Did he say such things at all, in any context? His response to a channel that carried his speech: \u201cNothing was said in Akola that was insulting to the farmers. Using specific parts of the speech, the opposition is now making a mountain out of a molehill. The speech has been used in such a way that it appears to be insulting the farmers. Being a farmer myself I know of the hardships faced by them. Implementing programmes for their benefit is primary for me.\u201d Which \u201cspecific parts?\u201d Obviously, the Chief Minister said things he would like to distance himself from. But it is very difficult to do that when those \u201cspecific parts\u201d are on camera and are repeatedly being telecast. The subsequent exercise seems to result more in damage expansion than damage control. </p> <p>The fallout has been most damaging. It was barely a month ago that Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s own party in the State gave in a report to its Central leadership, slamming his failures on the farm front. In Vidharbha region, his own party workers see this speech as a blunder that will cost them dearly. And party leaders in Delhi seem quite annoyed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a seed industry lobby has just advanced claims of stunning success for the Vidharbha farmer with Bt cotton. Yet this presents the leaders with a dilemma. The timing of the industry\u2019s claims is odd. It comes when the State is struggling to polish its image on the Vidharbha front. The claim is that the farmer in the region actually earned thousands of crores of rupees more last year. For one thing: how did \u201clazy\u201d farmers end up doing so well? For another, that was the same year in which the State government\u2019s own survey declared that over three fourths of farm households there were in distress. Of course, the State survey studied 17.64 lakh farm households or millions of people. The industry\u2019s \u2018sample\u2019 was less than 350 farmers in the region.</p> <p>More vital, though, is how the whole drama captures the elite mindset. Those doing badly are in trouble because of their own laziness. If they were hard-working, there would be no problem. Killing themselves in large numbers only proves how lazy they are. Most top leaders of  the State have not visited a single distressed farm household of their own accord through all this period of crisis. The same leaders always have time for Bollywood functions. Maharashtra\u2019s top bosses met families of suicide victims \u2014 most reluctantly \u2014 for the first time in 2006. That\u2019s because they had to tag along with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his trip to Vidharbha last year. </p> <p>It\u2019s curious how Maharashtra, with its \u201clazy\u201d farmers, led the country for three or more decades in cotton and sugar production before running into trouble. According to this government, the last season saw a gigantic \u201cbumper crop\u201d of almost 350 lakh quintals of cotton. And now industry says the next crop will exceed even that by 100 lakh quintals. Not bad for a bunch of lazy farmers fighting floods, pest, rising input costs, falling prices, chikangunya and their own government. </p> <p>Well over 90 per cent of  the State\u2019s cotton is produced in rain-fed regions. For farmers in Vidharbha to produce the quality they do with no irrigation is a huge achievement.  More so when the State itself is plugging inputs like Bt seed that demand more and more water. This hardly squares with their being lazy. </p> <p>Above all, the farmers of the region the two leaders were mocking have had to contend with a government that came to power on a promise of Rs. 2700 per quintal of cotton \u2014 then betrayed that promise at once. So who is the cheat? The mythical little guy wetting his cotton to make it heavier? Or a government whose ruthless gutting of a poll promise destroyed so many lives? Or was the Congress party\u2019s manifesto quoted \u201cout of context?\u201d </p> <p>Yet all this is like a re-run of a very bad movie. It is what the elite like to believe of the poor. In 2003-04, as reports on the Andhra Pradesh suicides grew in number, many well-read persons in Maharashtra asked in wide-eyed innocence: \u201cwhat is it with these Andhra Pradesh farmers? What\u2019s wrong with them? How come we don\u2019t have those suicides here in Maharashtra?\u201d </p> <p>Three years on, we all know better. But Mr. Vaghela, apparently, does not. He also overlooked the \u201cadvantage\u201d that Gujarat enjoys in two respects. It has the biggest \u201cparallel\u201d or <em style=\"i\">chor</em> Bt seed industry. Some farmers claim that the \u2018desi\u2019 Bt coming out of Gujarat works better than Monsanto\u2019s product. So many cotton growers in Gujarat don\u2019t pay the gigantic royalties per bag that they would to the multinational were they forced to use its brand. In Maharashtra, a government agency is the distributor for the most expensive Bt seed of the MNC. That\u2019s why farmers in Vidharbha in fact try to buy the Gujarati version. Some even respectfully call it \u201cnon-royalty Bt.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers in Gujarat also have up to 40 per cent irrigation, in one estimate. Which dwarfs Vidharbha\u2019s three per cent. There is another \u201cadvantage\u201d no less risky. All the States going through the crisis have seen cycles of large-scale, new generation chemical use. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Vidharbha went into those cycles before Gujarat did. (And they too saw initial gains.) The rest, we know, is history. And Mr. Vaghela, at least, ought to learn from it. There are huge problems ahead. </p> <p>Whether Mr. Deshmukh will learn is another question altogether. There have been two years in which Vidharbha could have been turned around quite a bit. But the laziness that came in the way was not that of the farmer. The laziness in forgetting what your manifesto promised was also not that of the farmer. Nor is the laziness involved in going to the region many times without visiting the affected households. Something real leaders ought to do. </p> <p>Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s own government has made one major contribution. It carried out the largest survey ever of its kind on farm households in the region. Its own survey says close to 75 per cent of farm households \u2014 or nearly seven million people \u2014 there are in distress. In just six districts. It confirms that people were and are working harder and harder to earn less and less. That some two million people are in what the survey calls \u201cmaximum distress.\u201d </p> <p>Brushing aside your own findings and holding forth on the failings of the farmers invites public outrage. And that outrage has come, leading to the \u201cclarifications.\u201d The causes of farm distress have been documented many times over both in Vidharbha and in other regions. To push the kind of reasons Mr. Vaghela and Mr. Deshmukh have advanced is to emulate the French Queen at the time of the 1789 Revolution who wanted to know why, if the hungry masses did not have bread, they could not eat cake instead. Current wisdom is that she never really said this. (Perhaps, like Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s, her words were \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d) Either way, Marie Antoinette would have felt at home in Maharashtra. Here we destroy the masses, not royalty.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\"

While the suicides occurred in many States, nearly two-thirds of such deaths were concentrated in five States where just a third of the country\u2019s population lives. This means that farm suicides occurred in these (mainly cash crop) regions with appalling intensity. </p> <p>The five States are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh (including Chattisgarh) and Kerala. Of these, only Kerala showed no sustained increase in the number of yearly farm suicides over this period. That was mainly because of a decline after 2003, which was that State\u2019s worst year. Maharashtra, for which data exists from 1995, is by far the worst-hit. Farm suicides there more than trebled from 1083 in 1995 to 3926 in 2005. </p> <p>Suicides as a whole rose nationally in the 1997-2005 period. But the rate of increase in farm suicides was far higher than the rate of increase in suicides by non-farmers. In Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, the percentage increase in farm suicides were more than double the increase in non-farm suicides in this period. </p> <p>While suicides by non-farmers went up by 23 per cent in the Big Four States, farm suicides went up by 52 per cent. Indeed, these States might be termed the \u201cSuicide SEZ\u201d or \u201cSpecial Elimination Zone\u201d for farmers this past decade. In 1997, these States accounted for 53 per cent, or just over half of all farm suicides in the country.

Nagaraj of the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS), \u201cthe trend for this group of States looks quite dismal. All four have, over the nine-year period, shown an ascending trend in farmers\u2019 suicides.\u0336\r\n1; This emerges from the painstaking study on farmers\u2019 suicides in India between 1997 and 2005 that Professor Nagaraj has just concluded. The study draws on data from the National Crime Records Bureau.</p> <p>\u201cThey began keeping farm data only from 1995,\u201d says Professor Nagaraj. \u201cBut significant States did not start reporting their data till about two years later. So the study begins with the year 1997. And 2005 is the last year for which such data were available nationally.\u201d He has also drawn on the 2001 Census in order to calculate the suicide rate for farmers (FSR). That is, suicides per 100,000 farmers.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>The number of Indians committing suicide each year rose from around 96,000 in 1997 to roughly 1.14 lakh in 2005. In the same period, the number of farmers taking their own lives each year shot up dramatically. From under 14,000 in 1997 to over 17,000 in 2005. While the rise in farm suicides has been on for over a decade, there have been sharp spurts in some years. For instance, 2004 saw well over 18,200 farm suicides across India. Almost two-thirds of these were in the Big Four or \u2018Suicide SEZ\u2019 States.</p> <p> The year 1998, too, saw a huge increase over the previous year. Farm suicides crossed the 16,000 mark, beating the preceding year by nearly 2,400 such deaths. Farm suicides as a proportion of total suicides rose from 14.2 in 1997 to 15.0 in 2005.</p> <p>Professor Nagaraj also points to the Annual Compound Growth Rate (ACGR) \u201cfor suicides nationally, for suicides amongst farmers, and those committed using pesticides.\u201d</p> <p>The ACGR for all suicides in India over a nine-year period is 2.18 per cent. This is not very much higher than the population growth rate. But for farm suicides it is much higher, at nearly 3 (or 2.91) per cent. Powerfully, the ACGR for suicides committed by consuming pesticide was 2.5 per cent. Close to the figure for farmers. </p> <p>Such suicides are often linked to the farm crisis, with pesticide being the handiest tool available to the farmer. \u201cThere are clear, disturbing patterns and trends in both farmers\u2019 suicides and pesticide suicides,\u201d says Professor Nagaraj.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Alarming though that is, it still does not capture the full picture. The data on suicides are complex, and sometimes misleading. And not just because of the flawed manner in which they are put together, or because of who puts them together. There are other problems, too. Farmers\u2019 suicides as a percentage of total farmers is hard to calculate on a yearly basis. A clear national \u2018farm suicide rate\u2019 can be derived only for 2001. That is because we have the Census to tell us how many farmers there were in the country that year. For other years, that figure would be a conjecture, however plausible.</p> <p>But even in 2001, when the farm suicides were not yet at their worst, the farm suicide rate (FSR) at 12.9 was much higher than the general suicide rate (GSR) at 10.6 for that year. But the GSR slowed down after that to 10.3 by 2005 even as the total number of suicides went up. It means that the increase in the number of general suicides did not keep pace with the growth in general population. But the FSR seems to have risen more steeply after 2001. By all accounts, while the number of farm suicides kept increasing, the number of farmers has fallen since 2001, with countless thousands abandoning agriculture.</p> <p>In 2005, the Big Four or \u2018Suicide SEZ\u2019 States accounted for 43.9 per cent of all suicides and 64.0 per cent of all farm suicides in the country. By contrast, a group of States with the highest general suicide rates \u2014 including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Tripura, and Puducherry \u2014 accounted for 20.5 per cent of farm suicides in India. \u201cTheir share of both total suicides and of farmers\u2019 suicides declined between 1997 and 2005 even as that of the Big Four steadily rose,\u201d points out Professor Nagaraj.</p> <p>To the extent the media have covered the farm crisis, their focus has been on farm suicides in four States \u2014 Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Very broadly speaking, that appears to have been right. All have very high rates of farmers\u2019 suicides. Madhya Pradesh though, is a major State showing such trends which has received scant attention. (Among smaller regions and States, Goa, and Puducherry show extremely high farm suicide rates but on tiny absolute numbers.)</p> <p>It is important that the figure of 1.5 lakh farm suicides is a bottom line estimate. It is by no means accurate or exhaustive. There are inherent and serious inaccuracies in the NCRB data as they are based on ground data that exclude large groups of people. As Professor Nagaraj puts it: \u201cThere is likely to be a serious underestimation of suicides, particularly of farmers\u2019 suicides, in these reports. The most important problem is the way a farmer is defined at the ground level: as someone who has a title to land. This is likely, for instance, to leave out tenant farmers and, particularly, women farmers.\u201d</p> <p>The quality of reporting also varies from State to State. For instance, Haryana shows a very low ratio of farm suicides to general suicides. This conflicts with other assessments of the problem in that State. Data from Punjab have also been highly contested by groups monitoring the farm crisis there.</p> <p>However, even in this flawed data, the trends are clear and alarming. But what has driven the huge increase in farm suicides, particularly in the Big Four or \u2018Suicide SEZ\u2019 States? \u201cOverall,\u201d says Professor Nagaraj, \u201cthere exists since the mid-90s, an acute agrarian crisis. That\u2019s across the country. In the Big Four and some other States, specific factors compound the problem. These are zones of highly diversified, commercialised agriculture. Cash crops dominate. (And to a lesser extent, coarse cereals.) Water stress has been a common feature \u2014 and problems with land and water have worsened as state investment in agriculture disappears. Cultivation costs have shot up in these high input zones, with some inputs seeing cost hikes of several hundred per cent. The lack of regulation of these and other aspects of agriculture have sharpened those problems. Meanwhile, prices have crashed, as in the case of cotton, due to massive U.S.-EU subsidies to their growers. Or due to price rigging with the tightening grip of large corporations over the trade in agricultural commodities.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\u201cFrom the mid-\u201890s onwards,\u201d points out Professor Nagaraj, \u201cprices and farm incomes crashed. As costs rose \u2014 even as bank credit dried up \u2014 so did indebtedness. Even as subsidies for corporate farmers in the West rose, we cut our few, very minimal life supports and subsidies to our own farmers. The collapse of investment in agriculture also meant it was and is most difficult to get out of this trap.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p

Worse, the farmers\u2019 suicide rate (FSR) \u2014 number of suicides per 100,000 farmers \u2014 is also likely to be much higher than the disturbing 12.9 thrown up in the 2001 Census.</p> <p>In the five years from 1997 to 2001, there were 78,737 farm suicides recorded in the country. On average, around 15,747 each year. But in just the next four years 2002-05, there were 70,507. Or a yearly average of 17,627 farm suicides. That is a rise of nearly 1,900 in the yearly averages of the two periods. Simply put, farm suicides have shot up after 2001 with the agrarian crisis biting deeper.</p> <p>A comprehensive study of official data on farm suicides by K. Nagaraj of the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) pins down these and other figures. The data analysed by Professor Nagaraj are drawn from the various issues of <em style=\"i\">Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India</em>, a publication of the NCRB. But Professor Nagaraj also explains some of the reasons why the actual numbers and farmers\u2019 suicide rate (FSR) could be far higher.</p> <p>In 2001, when the farm suicides were not yet at their worst, the FSR at 12.9 was already higher than the General Suicide Rate (GSR) \u2014 suicides per 100,000 population \u2014 at 10.6. But even this higher suicide rate among farmers conceals a far worse reality. Firstly, the NCRB data seem to underestimate the number of farm suicides. This is because the criteria adopted for identifying a farm suicide at the State level are quite stringent. For instance, women and tenant farmers tend to get excluded from lists of farmers\u2019 suicides. In those lists, only those with a title to land tend to be counted as farmers. On the other hand, the Census data are based on a very liberal definition of \u2018cultivator.\u2019</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>The 2001 Census gives data on two categories of cultivators: Cultivators among \u2018main workers\u2019 and those among \u2018marginal workers.\u2019 For the first group \u2014 cultivators among main workers \u2014 farming is the main activity. The second group includes those who practice cultivation only on a sporadic basis. However, both groups get counted as farmers. The net result of this is that while deriving the farm suicide rate from the NCRB and Census data, we are saddled with figures that undercount farm suicides but overcount the number of \u2018farmers.\u2019 Hence a value of 12.9 for the FSR is likely to be way below the mark. As Professor Nagaraj points out, \u201cIf we took only the cultivators among the main workers as farmers, the FSR increases dramatically to 15.8 which is nearly one and a half times the GSR of 10.6 in 2001.\u201d</p> <p>Secondly, the FSR is anchored in 2001 because that is the year of the Census. However, it was not one of the worst years in terms of farm suicides. Farm suicides in that year actually fell when compared to the previous year, 2000. But the very next year, in 2002, farmers\u2019 suicides leapt by about 10 per cent. And the number of such deaths peaked in 2004. So while the number of farmers\u2019 suicides shows a rising trend after 2001, the number of farmers may well have declined.</p> <p>The trend of a decline in cultivators seems to have begun even earlier. The 1991 Census says there were 111 million cultivators among main workers. This fell to 103 million in the 2001 Census. This decline would surely have sharpened after 2001 as the farm crisis deepened. Certainly farming has no new takers.</p> <p>As Professor Nagaraj\u2019s study shows, the Annual Compound Growth rate (ACGR) for all suicides in India over the nine-year period 1997-2005 is 2.18 per cent. This is not very much higher than the population growth rate. For farm suicides, it is much higher, at nearly 3 (or 2.91) per cent. An ACGR of 3 per cent in farm suicides is more alarming as it applies to a smaller total of farmers each year. This means the farm suicide rate must have shot up after 2001.</p> <p>Suicides by farmers went up 27 per cent during the 1997-2005 period. But non-farm suicides went up by 18 per cent. Indeed, the general suicide rate declined after 2001 \u2014 from 10.6 in 2001 to 10.3 in 2005. Which means the increase in general suicides has not kept pace with the increase in the general population. So by all accounts, while the number of farm suicides kept increasing, the number of farmers has fallen since 2001, with countless thousands abandoning agriculture in distress. Which would mean that farm suicides are mounting even as the farm population slowly declines.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Lastly, whether we take the farm suicide rate as 12.9 or 15.8, it is the figure for the country as a whole. That again hides huge differentials in the numbers and intensity of farm suicides across the country. There are States and regions in the country where the FSR is appallingly high. There are regions where it is mercifully still low.</p> <p>Professor Nagaraj accordingly divided the States into four groups. Group I: States with very high general suicide rates. Group II: States with high general suicide rates and large numbers of farmers\u2019 suicides. (This is the most important group.) Group 3: States with moderate general and farm suicide rates. And Group 4: States with low general and farm suicide rates (See Table).</p> <p>What demarcates the Group II States \u2014 clearly the worst hit \u2014 is also the trend in suicides, which is most dismal there. This key group includes Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh (including Chhattisgarh) and Goa. (The last with tiny absolute numbers.) The ratio of farmers\u2019 suicide rate to the general suicide rate was highest in this Group (see Table). The overall ratio of this group is 1.7. Which means the farm suicide rate in these States is 70 per cent higher than it is in their whole population.</p> <p> Of the major States, Maharashtra has the worst figure with a ratio of farmers\u2019 suicide rate to general suicide rate of 2.0. That is, one hundred per cent higher. This is followed by Karnataka with 1.6. Of the smaller States, Kerala (from Group I) has the awful figure of 4.7. But it also shows a decline from 2004. Puducherry shows up as the worst with 15.4. Of course, the last two have smaller absolute numbers.</p> <p>The trend for Group II is most dismal. The AGCR for farm suicides in these States for the 1997-2005 period was 5.33. Or nearly double the national figure of 2.9. And if this trend holds, farm suicides in this group as a whole would double every 13 years. Among  these States, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh would fare even worse.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font

No other State comes close to that total. This means that of the roughly 1.5 lakh farmers who killed themselves across the country in that period, almost every fifth one was from Maharashtra \u2014 which saw a 105 per cent increase in farm suicides in those nine years. More than 19,000 of those farmer suicides occurred from 2001 onwards.</p> <p>These dismal findings emerge from a major study of official data on farm suicides by K. Nagaraj of the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS). Professor Nagaraj has analysed data recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Ministry of Home Affairs, from 1997 to 2005 (see Table). The study begins with 1997 because that was the year when most States began reporting farm data regularly.</p> <p>However, Maharashtra is a State that did report farm data in 1995 and 1996, too. If we include those two years, then the number of farm suicides in the 1995-2005 period was almost 32,000. An increase of over 260 per cent between those years. Maharashtra is one of the country\u2019s richest States. Its capital, Mumbai, is home to 25,000 of India\u2019s 100,000 dollar millionaires.</p> <p>Professor Nagaraj\u2019s study shows that of the almost 1.5 lakh farm suicides in India between 1997 and 2005, over 89,000 occurred in just four States: Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh (including Chhattisgarh). Importantly, Maharashtra accounts for a third of all farm suicides within these Big Four States. \u201cThis State,\u201d says Professor Nagaraj, \u201ccould be called the graveyard of farmers.\u201d</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>In terms of a percentage increase in farm suicides between 1997 and 2005, Andhra Pradesh\u2019s figure is actually higher than that of Maharashtra. Andhra Pradesh saw a 127 per cent increase in farm suicides in the 1997-2005 period. Then what makes Maharashtra worst amongst the Big Four? In all the other three States, suicides by non-farmers also rose massively in this period. Non-farmer suicides shot up 48 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, 48 per cent in Madhya Pradesh, and 15 per cent in Karnataka. The crisis was more generalised across sections of society.</p> <p>In Maharashtra, suicides by non-farmers actually saw a decline of 2 per cent in those years. That means the intensity of the crisis was borne almost entirely by the farming community. So farm suicides rose steeply, even as non-farm suicides fell marginally. </p> <p>The percentage increase in farm suicides for Andhra Pradesh (127 per cent) was higher than in Maharashtra (105 per cent) if we take the 1997-2005 period. However, these are both States where the data go back to 1995. Taking that year as the base, the percentage increase of farm suicides in Maharashtra was 263 per cent over 1995-2005. For Andhra Pradesh, it was 108 per cent over the same period. This translates into a very high annual compound growth rate (ACGR) of 7.6 per cent in farmers\u2019 suicides in Andhra Pradesh for the period 1995-2005. Which implies farm suicides there might double in 10 years if present trends hold. Maharashtra\u2019s ACGR for the same period was 13.7. Which means farmers\u2019 suicides here could double in six years, given the same trends.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Unlike for most States, some region-specific data on farm distress do exist in Maharashtra. Thanks to public action and activism, positive court intervention, and media pressure, the State Government was forced to keep some record, however flawed. Also, a paper by the then Divisional Commissioner, Amravati, S.K Goel, clearly recorded the situation in the Vidharbha region. Besides, the Maharashtra Government held the largest-ever door-to-door survey of its kind in the region in 2006. This study covered every farm household in Vidharbha\u2019s six \u2018crisis\u2019 districts using 10,000 investigators. It captured a portrait of distress and crisis (<em style=\"i\">The\u2002Hindu</em>, Nov. 22, 2006).</p> <p>It found that of the 17 lakh plus families covered, more than a fourth \u2014 that is, more than two million people \u2014 were \u201cunder maximum distress.\u201d And more than three quarters of the rest were \u201cunder medium distress.\u201d In short, almost seven million people were in distress. The major sources of such misery: debt and crop loss or crop failure (which often overlap). The pressure on farmers who cannot afford their daughters\u2019 marriages. And rising health costs.</p> <p>The paper by Dr. Goel, \u201cFarmers\u2019 Suicides in Maharashtra: An Overview,\u201d placed some of this data on record. While his reading of some of the data does not hold up, his contribution to the study of the subject has been quite vital.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Among other things, the paper reveals that the total number of suicides in the six districts between 2001 and 2006 was extremely high at 15,980. Worse, the number went up from 2,425 in 2005 to 2,832 in 2006 \u2014 an increase of 407 in a single year. (And in 2006 both the Prime Minister\u2019s and Chief Minister\u2019s \u201crelief packages\u201d were at work.) The paper also confirms indebtedness as a factor in 93 per cent of farm suicides. The next highest factor being \u201ceconomic downfall\u201d \u2014 at 74 per cent.</p> <p>However, only the state gets to decide which suicide is a \u201cfarmers\u2019 suicide.\u201d The Maharashtra Government\u2019s efforts show much creative accounting. The Nagpur Bench of the Mumbai High Court compelled the government to maintain suicide statistics on its official website from mid-2006. But with a few exceptions, the media never really picked up the damaging data on the website. And the government was free to play with definitions of what was a \u201cgenuine\u201d farm suicide.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>As a result, less than 20 per cent of the 15,980 suicides are by \u201cfarmers.\u201d This, in overwhelmingly rural districts! (For instance, 80 per cent of Yavatmal\u2019s population is rural.) And just a fraction of that \u2014 1,290 cases \u2014 are accepted by the government as distress suicides worthy of compensation. This is achieved by inspired jugglery, as the accompanying table (I) shows.</p> <p>The first columns give you total suicides each year. Take 2005 for instance, which saw 2,425 suicides in these districts. The next column is \u201cFarmers\u2019 Suicides.\u201d Just 468 of them. Then an extraordinary column: \u201cFamily members\u2019 suicides.\u201d That figure is 559. That is, it holds that family members on the farm committing suicide are not farmers. This helps skim down the figure further. Next comes the total of these two followed by \u201cInvestigated cases.\u201d The final column invents a new category unknown elsewhere: \u201cEligible suicides\u201d. That is, suicides the government deems genuine and due for compensation. And so, for 2005, the suicides column that begins at 2,425 ends with 273. This amputated figure then, for propaganda purposes, becomes the number of \u201cfarmers\u2019 suicides.\u201d This way, a \u2018decline\u2019 in farm suicides is \u2018established.\u2019</p> <p>The contortions are best seen in the category of \u201cEligible\u201d suicides. Indeed, there is a whole separate table \u2014 not reproduced here \u2014 on \u201cPercentage of eligible farmers suicides in six districts.\u201d And of course, \u201cEstimated eligible suicide cases\u201d show a decline. So the number of suicides keeps mounting \u2014 but the number of farm suicides keeps falling! If accepted at face value, this jugglery would imply that only farmers are doing well.</p> <p> Everybody else is sinking in Vidharbha. Read more seriously, the region specific data \u2014 viewed against the national and State figures \u2014 suggest that Vidharbha is today the worst place in the nation to be a farmer.</p> <p

But did we book any farmer for this offence? Have you reported that?\u201d </i>\u2014 Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on farm suicides in Vidharbha.</p> <p>\r\nThat is the Chief Minister\u2019s response to media questions on the ongoing farm suicides in Vidharbha. He has gone on record with that statement in an interview. (<em style=\"i\">The Hindustan Times, October 31.) Leave aside for the moment this incorrect reading of the law. Mr. Deshmukh clearly believes he has been merciful towards those committing the \u2018crime\u2019 of suicide. Thanks to his government\u2019s generosity, close to 32,000 farmers in his State wh\r\no have taken their lives since 1995 go scot-free. Imagine what would happen should he decide to book them for their \u2018crime.\u2019 For the record, on average, one farmer committed suicide every three hours in Maharashtra between 1997 and 2005. Since 2002, that has worsened to one such suicide every two-and-a-quarter hours. Those numbers emerge from official data. This could be the State\u2019s worst tragedy in living memory.</em></p> <p>Of course, the question arises: who would he punish if he decides to enforce what he believes is the law? And how would he do so? Would their ashes be disinterred from wherever to face the consequences of their actions? Would the awful majesty of the law be visited upon their survivors to teach them never to stray from the path of righteous conduct? Or \u2014 more likely \u2014 would his government set up yet another commission to look into the matter?</p> <p>Under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, attempting suicide is a crime. A suicide effort that succeeds places the victim beyond Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s reach anyway. Beyond anything for that matter. As one of India\u2019s foremost legal minds says: \u201cthe odd thing about suicide in India is that failing to commit it is a crime. One who succeeds in it is obviously beyond punishment. But the one who fails in his attempt to commit it could be in trouble. You could then be booked for \u2018attempted suicide,\u2019 an offence punishable by fine and even imprisonment.\u201d </p> <p>Abetment to suicide (Section 306) is also a crime. One that places Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s government in the dock if we persist with this logic of \u2018punishment.\u2019 His Ministry has been widely criticised on the farm suicides in this State. Many point to the rash of suicides that occurred soon after the government withdrew the \u2018advance bonus\u2019 of Rs.500 per quintal of cotton in 2005. A move that tanked cotton prices and brought disaster to lakhs of farmers in the State. </p> <p>Worse, his is a government which came to power that very year on a promise of giving cotton farmers a price of Rs.2700 a quintal. At the time, they were getting a mere Rs.2200 a quintal. A sum the government conceded was quite uneconomical. Further, neither the State nor the Central government took any steps at all to counter the distortion of global cotton prices. Prices crashed as both the United States and the European Union piled on subsidies worth billions of dollars to boost their cotton sectors. </p> <p>To top it all, the Deshmukh government withdrew the \u2018advance bonus\u2019 soon after coming to power. That brought the price down to just over Rs.1700 a quintal. And the Centre did not raise import duties on cotton despite desperate pleas for such an action. This allowed the large scale dumping of U.S. cotton on this country, further crushing the farmers here. No, Section 306 is not something Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s government would want to look into too closely. </p> <p>But to be fair to Mr. Deshmukh, he is neither unique nor alone in this mindset. There is something wrong with a society where suicide data are put together by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The idea is in-built: suicide is a crime. From that flows Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s simple notion of punishment. But he did not author the idea. He simply took it to unknown levels of insensitivity. With this statement, the Chief Minister outdid his previous effort when he made remarks about Vidharbha\u2019s farmers that caused a furore. Remarks that suggested that they were both lazy and less than honest. Of course, he soon rallied to say he had been \u201cquoted out of context.\u201d (<em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em>, September 15, 2007). So maybe he will do so this time, too.</p> <p>But he has certainly got the law out of context. What does Section 309 of the IPC really say? It states that \u201cwhoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such an offence shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with a fine or with both.\u201d </p> <p>Fact: even the British Raj seems never to have used Section 309 against Mahatma Gandhi or other fasting leaders. And they had the excuse to do so when faced with, for instance, fasts unto death. This surely had less to do with humane behaviour than the hope that leaders like Gandhi would succeed in their fast unto death and rid the empire of a menace. Still the fact is: they did not resort to Section 309. </p> <p>Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s words suggest that he is holding himself back with much effort. If governments do start enforcing Section 309, the damage would be huge. For every farm suicide that occurs, there are a fairly large number of attempts that fail. Mostly, the police do not press the issue too hard. Even they see the ill logic of oppressing someone in misery who tries, but fails, to take his or her own life. (Such pressures have in a few cases, triggered a second \u2014 successful \u2014 attempt at suicide.) Following the \u2018punishment\u2019 logic would make life a living hell for those already in despair.</p> <p> </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>For decades, social and legal workers and activists have struggled to decriminalise attempted suicide. One of them is Dr. Lakshmi Vijay Kumar, a consultant with the World Health Organisation on suicide research and prevention. As she puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy law. One which only a handful of nations still retain. Most others have withdrawn it years ago. Apart from us, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore seem to still have this kind of law. Sri Lanka too did but withdrew it in 1998. It\u2019s a law that punishes those most in need of help. A move to repeal it went through the Rajya Sabha in 1974. The bill was also introduced in the Lok Sabha but that house was dissolved before it could see it through.\u201d The Section was even struck down by a Supreme Court ruling in 1994. However, it was later reinstated by a full bench. </p> <p>As we write, the Maharashtra Assembly is in session.  In the tiny Assembly session ahead, the question of farm suicides is sure to crop up. Why is Maharashtra, with more dollar billionaires and millionaires than any other State in the country, home to the largest number of farmers\u2019 suicides in India? Why is it that farm suicides in this State trebled between 1995 and 2005? Why did  they go up so massively in a State where suicides amongst non-farmers fell marginally in the same period? </p> <p>All the data on farm suicides carried in <em style=\"i\">The Hindu</em> (Nov.12-15) are from the National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. They are not the data of this newspaper. Nor of Professor K. Nagaraj of the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) who authored the study reported in the paper. They are government data. So if Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s outfit has different numbers for the State Assembly, it could be in danger of committing contempt of the house. </p> <p>Maybe someone in the house will raise other questions too. Queries that go, as they should, way beyond the suicides. The suicides are, after all, a tragic window to a much larger agrarian crisis. They are a symptom of massive rural distress, not the process. A consequence of misery, not its cause. How many more commissions will the government appoint to tell itself what it wants to hear? When will it address the problems of price, credit and input costs, for instance? When will it, if at all, reflect on the role of cash crops in the crisis? When will it push Delhi to set up a Centre-State price stabilisation fund? When will it dig its head out of the sand? </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\"

That is roughly twice the \u201cloan waiver\u201d given to millions of Indian farmers. The latter move has been scorched by the ideologues of the free market and neo-liberalism as \u201cfiscal insanity\u201d or \u201cirreversible damage.\u201d The media \u2014 even those mildly critical \u2014 have been far more muted in their criticism of the \u2018rescue\u2019 of Bear Stearns. That \r\nis, one of the biggest global investment banks and securities trading and brokerage firms anywhere on the planet.</p> <p>Think of it: a tiny Wall Street cabal which gave itself bonuses worth billions of dollars just weeks before the crash gets a bailout of Rs.1,19,520 crore. That\u2019s almost double the Rs.60,000 crore given to tens of millions of farmers in dire straits in this country. A country where one farmer kills himself every 30 minutes in despair. The problems of farmers do not even begin to end with that waiver.</p> <p>On the other hand, a bunch of thugs in tuxedos who did pretty much whatever they wanted, laying a minefield across the world, have got the waiver of a lifetime (or many lifetimes). The lifejacket for the bank does not require the return of their bonuses. So much so that Jim Rogers, CEO of Rogers Holdings and a staunch free marketer, calls it \u201cSocialism for the rich.\u201d In his words \u201cthe Federal Reserve is using taxpayer money to buy a bunch of Bear Stearns traders\u2019 Maseratis.\u201d He points out that hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent to bail out Wall Street as a whole. The theologians of the global market are between a rock and a hard place. Hypocrisy has rammed into reality. </p> <p>Three of the basic principles the believers of corporate-led globalisation swear by have been so eloquently summed by Professor James Galbraith Jr of the University of Texas at Austin. One: all successes are global. Two: all failures are national. Three: the market is beyond reproach.</p> <p>For over a decade, we were assured that everything good that ever happened was because we had embraced corporate-led globalisation. All the negative effects visible were the result of our own national inertia and corruption. And of course, the market would heal all wounds. The notion of state meddling in  economic matters was blasphemy. Now the nations feeding us this rot \u2014 which we recite by rote \u2014 are nationalising banks, bailing out brigands and pouring in funds to stop factories from closing down. </p> <p>Now having to blame \u2018global factors\u2019 for the price rise at home must seem a bit galling. Failures at home? Er, well, you see, let\u2019s not go there now. This is election year. So we see Minister after Minister, the latest being Kapil Sibal, tell us that the price rise and food shortages in India are the \u201cresult of global factors.\u201d Nothing to do with us. No less amusing to see the World Bank and the IMF warn of starvation and riots. It\u2019s hard to think of anyone who has contributed more to those phenomena than they have. And now Finance Minister P. Chidambaram calls for an urgent \u201cglobal consensus on the price spiral.\u201d Without this, social unrest would conflagrate into a \u201cglobal contagion.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair to the Union Agriculture Minister, he alone has not laid the blame at the door of faceless global forces.  Sharad Pawar locates the problem closer home. In his view, south Indians are eating too many chapathis, leading to shortages of wheat. (<em style=\"i\">DNA</em> page 1, April 2, 2008). An entertaining view but there\u2019s a problem with it. Even while dietary changes do affect consumption patterns, these occur over decades. There is little evidence of an outburst of wheat-centric gluttony in the southern States these past six months. (Unless, of course, with great cunning, the southies are hoarding it up for future chapathi orgies.)</p> <p>Someone is hoarding it up, though, and it is not the general public, south or north. The presence of very large traders including MNCs buying directly from farmers has been on awhile. A process aided by our strangling of the old Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees\u2019 Act. We\u2019ve set the soil for contract farming and corporate agriculture. Meanwhile, the lip service paid to higher Minimum Support Prices (MSP) has proved worse than a sham. In practice, producers are being pushed towards private trade. Fewer procurement centres, delays in purchasing and, still worse, delays in payments are the norm. Then, when procurement is poor, we announce that the farmers are doing so well in the market, they don\u2019t want to sell to the state. </p> <p>The present mess was arrived at with much celebration of the farmer\u2019s right to sell as and when he liked, to whom he wished. In effect, millions of farmers, deep in trouble, have been selling their produce at distress rates for several seasons now. The bargaining power of individual farmers on their own is zilch. </p> <p>Total procurement has been down. When market prices for the farmers\u2019 produce have been higher than the MSP, this might be expected. But it has happened even when the MSP has been raised. There have also been cases of traders picking up produce from indebted farmers and then claiming the higher MSP on it themselves. On the whole, though, smaller traders are in trouble. The big boys are here. And so even with enough grain within the country just now, the less well-off cannot access it at affordable rates.</p> <p>The Centre\u2019s pressing the States to act against hoarding is itself an admission of the problem. But there is yet to be a single instance of action against really big hoarders and speculators. These include giant companies operating through a variety of pointmen. The raids now focussed on small traders will yield little. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the entry and growing entrenchment of giants in retail ensures things will get worse. (Remember this was supposed to provide us with cheap prices? Then look at the gap between wholesale and retail prices.) </p> <p>We have also nurtured the commodities futures market despite its clear links to speculation and price rise. It\u2019s odd how every other small trader will brief you at length on this \u2014 but you won\u2019t see much of that story in the media. In fact, with markets tanking around the world, more speculators have seized on foodgrain as a good bet. Which it is.</p> <p>Through the reforms period, we have pushed millions of small farmers to shift from foodcrop to cash crops. The acreage under foodcrop has reduced across these years. And we also exported millions of tonnes of grain \u2014 as in 2002 and 2003. What\u2019s more, we exported at prices cheaper than those we charged poor people in this country for the same grain. The idea was that we had a \u201chuge surplus\u201d of grain and could well afford to export. The truth was that the massive pileup of unsold stock arose from a surplus of hunger rather than of grain. The purchasing power of the poor had collapsed. But the fake \u201csurplus\u201d story came in handy. It allowed the export of grain \u2014 heavily subsidised by us \u2014 to be consumed by European cattle.</p> <p>The present mess is no surprise. For years, economists  such as Utsa Patnaik have warned strongly that we would arrive at where we are now. As she repeatedly pointed out, the effects of all our actions could be seen in the plummeting net per capita availability of foodgrain. From 510 grams per Indian in 1991 to 422 grams by 2005. With the top fifth of Indians doing better than ever before, this meant that those below were eating far less than they did just a few years ago.</p> <p>The plunging food intake of the poorer sections has come along with the steady scrapping of the public distribution system. On the one hand, the PDS has been sharply whittled down. On the other, millions who need BPL cards are denied them. In Mumbai, just 0.28 per cent of ration cardholders have BPL cards. Now, even those who do have cards find no supplies to buy. </p> <p>And of course, we\u2019ve spared no efforts to link our agriculture to the volatility of global prices in a world where a handful of corporations control those prices. Their clout within India has grown rapidly. Their control extends further each day from the field and farm gate to the price and sale of the final product.</p> <p>Meanwhile, each budget takes further the process of \u201cgrowth\u201d driven by the consumption of the rich. Tax breaks at the top, cuts in state spending, all these too have a major role in making life unbearable below.</p> <p>Yet, even as the edifice crumbles, a few true believers hold out for the Second Coming. \u201cPrice rise reflects scarcity,\u201d says one editorial, \u201cand at no time is free trade more effective as a welfare enhancer than when it combats scarcity by quickly getting supplies where the demand is.\u201d But governments are \u201cdenying free trade this role.\u201d Well, get set for the global contagion.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p

Since 2002, that has become one  suicide every 30 minutes. However, the frequency at which farmers take their lives in any region smaller than the country \u2014 say a single State or group of States \u2014 has to be lower. Because the number of  suicides in any such region would be less than the total for the country as a whole in any year. Yet,  the frequency at which farmers are killing themselves in many regions is appalling.</p> <p>On average, one farmer took his or her life every 53 minutes between 1997 and 2005 in just the  States of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh (including Chhattisgarh). In Maharashtra alone, that was one  suicide every three hours. It got even worse after 2001. It rose to one farm suicide every 48 minutes in these Big Four States, and one every two and a quarter hours in Maharashtra alone. The Big Four  have together seen 89,362 farmers\u2019 suicides between 1997 and 2005, or 44,102 between 2002 and 2005.</p> <p>K. Nagaraj of the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS), who has studied farmers\u2019 suicides between 1997-2005 based on the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, divides the States into four groups. The worst of these is Group II which includes, besides the Big Four, the State of Goa which shows a high farmers\u2019 suicide rate (FSR) \u2014 that is,  suicides per 1,00,000 farmers. However, Goa\u2019s rate is based on tiny absolute numbers. All Group II States have high general suicide rates (GSR) \u2014 suicides per 1,00,000 population \u2014 and have seen large numbers of farm suicides.</p> <p>Of these, Andhra Pradesh shows some decline in 2005. And the government claims the numbers have fallen further in 2006. But there is no NCRB data to support this as yet. In all, if the NCRB data are valid, then Andhra Pradesh saw 16,770 suicides between 1997 and 2005.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Andhra Pradesh was the first State after the 2004 polls to appoint a commission to go into the agrarian crisis. Based on the commission\u2019s advice, it also took some steps towards handling that crisis. It restored compensation for the suicides that had been stopped by the previous regime in 1998. It persuaded creditors to accept a one-time settlement of debt in several cases. This possibly helped see a decline after the terrible years of 2002-04. However, Andhra Pradesh has begun to mimic Maharashtra in one unhappy aspect. The number of \u201cnon-genuine\u201d cases \u2014 those the government does not accept as distress-linked \u2014 keeps mounting each month while the \u201cgenuine\u201d suicides decline.</p> <p>There are other problems too. Several States, notably Maharashtra, have made identification of farmers\u2019 suicides extremely difficult by using indicators that rule out vast numbers from being categorised as such. One problem with such corruption of data is that it will eventually reflect in and distort future NCRB reports as well.</p> <p>Karnataka too records some decline in 2004 and 2005, after a disastrous five-year period. And the State\u2019s 15 per cent increase in non-farmers committing suicide in the 1997-2005 period is five times higher than the rise in farmers\u2019 suicides (3 per cent). But the damage of those earlier years was huge. Karnataka saw as many as 20,093 farm suicides in the period. Again, it is unclear whether the lower numbers for 2004-05 were largely due to policy measures or whether there have been new and creative accounting techniques.</p> <p>\u201cMadhya Pradesh appears to have long been a problem State for farmers, though this has not been so far acknowledged,\u201d says Professor Nagaraj. \u201cThe increase in farm suicides over the nine-year period 1997-2005 is not so high, at 11 per cent, but the absolute numbers have been very high for a long period. Much higher than in many other States. However, here too, the rise in non-farmer suicides, at 48 per cent, is more than four times the increase in farmers\u2019 suicides.\u201d Madhya Pradesh (including Chhattisgarh) saw 23,588 farm suicides in the 1997-2005 period. However, Madhya Pradesh has mostly escaped the media radar as a farm crisis State. In Group II States, farm suicides as a percentage of total suicides reached 21.9 in 2005 against a national average of 15.5. In short, more than one of every five persons taking his or her life in these States that year was a farmer. Also, one in every four suicides in this group was committed using pesticide.</p> <p>One State outside the Big Four that has seen high numbers of farmers\u2019 suicides is Kerala. It saw a total of 11,516 in 1997-2005. Worse, many of these occurred in small districts such as Wayanad. Kerala shows a fluctuating but declining trend over the nine-year period. The years 1998 to 2003 were clearly its worst period.  More than 70 per cent of its farm suicides  occurred in those years. From 2004, the numbers begin to drop. So much so that unlike the Big Four, it shows no increases in farm suicides for the whole period. The post-2003 fall, in fact, makes its overall figure minus 7 per cent.</p> <p>Kerala created a \u201cDebt Relief Commission\u201d soon after the change in government there in 2005. The Commission held a case by case scrutiny of the debt problem, while the government halted aggressive loan recovery measures by banks and money lenders. On the Commission\u2019s advice, the government also decided to declare the entire Wayanad revenue district distress-affected.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>The improvement is quite fragile and could easily see a downturn. Kerala\u2019s farm suicide rate for the period is very high, and the State remains vulnerable to volatility in the prices of, for instance, coffee, pepper, cardamom or vanilla. A fragility enhanced by the fact that major relief on the debt front requires Central help. Besides, State bureaucracies are extremely hostile to debt relief for farmers. Also, India\u2019s free trade agreements with nations and neighbours that produce the same cash crops as Kerala  hurts badly. The State\u2019s balance on the farm suicides front is very delicate. Complacence would be, literally, fatal.</p> <p>Group I States are those which have very high general suicide rates. That includes Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, West Bengal, and Tripura. \u201cHowever, Group I\u2019s share of both total suicides and of farmers\u2019 suicides declined between 1997 and 2005, even as that of Group II steadily rose,\u201d points out Professor Nagaraj.</p> <p>Group III States (Assam, Orissa, Gujarat, and Haryana) are those which have \u201cmoderate general and farm suicide rates,\u201d while Group IV States (Bihar including Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh including Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan) report \u201clow general and farmers\u2019 suicides rates.\u201d</p> <p>Generally speaking, the Gangetic plain region and eastern India have seen fewer farm suicides. States such as Uttar Pradesh (including Uttaranchal), Bihar (including Jharkhand) and Orissa report very few suicides of this kind. These States are in many respects the opposite of the Group II or \u2018Suicide SEZ\u2019 States. These are overwhelmingly food crop regions. They are not intensive input zones, and their costs of cultivation are much lower. Use of chemicals is not anywhere at the levels it is in the Group II States. Government support prices for food crop provide some minimal stability. And there is obviously a better water situation.</p> <p>States such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat also report few farm suicides but their data have been challenged. Haryana, for instance, reports fewer  suicides but its increase over the nine-year period was 211 per cent. This springs not from the recording of huge increases in recent years, but because the base year data appear highly flawed. For 1997, Haryana reports a spectacularly low 45  suicides. Which distorts the figure of increase in farm suicides across the period, pushing it upwards. \u201cIt could just have been that the counting operation was really shoddy or that it collapsed or was incomplete when data were sent in 1997,\u201d says Professor Nagaraj. The numbers after the low 1997 figure remain roughly within a 170-210 range each year. Which again is strongly contested by farm unions and activists.</p> <p>There are peculiar indications in Gujarat. Pesticide suicides \u2014 a common tool in farm suicides \u2014 are 84 per cent higher here than farm suicides.  At the national level, they are just 28 per cent higher. Why is the gap three times bigger for Gujarat? Even for Group II States, pesticide suicides are only 21 per cent higher than farm suicides. Which raises the question  whether several deaths in Gujarat  ended up being recorded as just \u201cpesticide suicides\u201d without being acknowledged as suicides by farmers.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2007111554771300.htm&amp;date=2007/11/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2007/11/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduretailplus.com/\">Retail Plus</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2007111554581200.htm\">The BJP\u2019s  southern debut</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007111554591201.htm\">A spreading scourge</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007111554611201.htm\">Parliamentary democracy &amp;

Even though  it was ranked 126 last year. So say unnamed officials (at least, according to a report in one newspaper). It seems the truth is that we would have been 128 anyway, even last year, \u201chad updated data been used for other countries.\u201d In short, we have not really slipped in rankings, you know,\r\n we were this bad all along. In Mumbai argot: \u201cWe are like this only.\u201d </p> <p>To begin with, the rank of 128 puts us in the bottom 50 of the 177 nations that the UNDP Human Development Report looks at. Treat Adivasis and Dalits as a separate nation and you will find that nation in the bottom 25. Or subtract our per capita GDP ranking from the process and watch India as a whole do a slide. Meanwhile, even nations that are far below us in the rankings \u2014 and which have nothing like our growth numbers \u2014 do much better than  us on many counts. So even if our HDI value took a tiny step up from 0.611 last year to 0.619, it means other nations did much better than us. And hence we went down to rank 128 this year. </p> <p>Each year since 1990, the Human Development Report (HDR) of the UNDP publishes the Human Development Index (HDI). This index \u201clooks beyond GDP to a broader definition of well-being.\u201d The HDI seeks to capture \u201cthree dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy at birth). Being educated (measured by adult literacy and enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education). And third: GDP per capita measured in U.S. dollars at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).\u201d </p> <p>Let us look at where we stand in the rankings of the index. El Salvador, which saw a bloody civil war for over a decade from the 1980s, ranks 25 places ahead of us at 103. Bolivia, often called South America\u2019s poorest nation, is 11 steps above us at 117. Guatemala, nearly half of whose citizens are poor indigenous people, saw the longest civil war in Central America. One that lasted close to four decades and which saw 200,000 people killed or disappear. That too, in a nation of just 12 million. Guatemala ranks 10 places above us at 118. </p> <p>In Africa, Botswana \u2014 ranked below us in the 2006 HDI at 131 \u2014 climbed four places above us at 124 this time. It replaced fellow African nation Gabon which quit that slot to move upwards to 119 this year. (Gee, their updated data arrived on time. Must be using a different courier service.) The Occupied Palestinian Territories, with all their woes, slipped six places to 106. Still well ahead of India. </p> <p>In Asia, countries like Vietnam \u2014 victim of the bloodiest conflict since World War II \u2014 rose further in the charts, to rank 105 this year. Sri Lanka, of course, is way ahead of us at 99. So are nations like Kazakhstan and Mongolia. They too have risen in the ranks. The former from 79 to 73 and the latter from 116 to 114. </p> <p>Note that some of these nations rank up to 30 slots above us. Others fall within 30 nations below us. Not one of them has had our nine per cent growth. Few of them have been touted an emerging economic superpower. Nor even as a software superpower. Not even as a blossoming nuclear power. Together, they probably do not have as many billionaires as India does. In short, even nations much poorer than us in Asia, Africa and Latin America have done a lot better than we have. </p> <p>India rose in the dollar billionaire rankings, though. From rank 8 in 2006 to number 4 in the Forbes list this year, but we slipped from 126 to 128 in human development. In the billionaire stakes, we are ahead of most of the planet and might even close in on two of the three nations ahead of us (Germany and Russia). It will, of course, be some time before we erase the national humiliation of lagging behind the top dog in that race, the United States. (Which, by the way, dropped from 8 to 12 in the HDI rankings this year.) </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>Cuba has zero standing in the roll call of billionaires. In terms of per capita income, it ranks low in the world. But when it comes to human development, it ranks 51 \u2014 that is, 77 places ahead of us. It figures in the HDI\u2019s \u2018High Human Development\u2019 group. This is a nation which has faced a huge economic blockade since its birth. U.S. sanctions ensure that almost everything is costlier in Cuba than in many other nations. In per capita terms, it spends four per cent of what the U.S. does on health but achieves better outcomes on most of the vital parameters of that sector. Despite its many disadvantages, it achieves a better HDI rank than Mexico, Russia or China. (All of which have gained more billionaires in recent times.) </p> <p>But there is hope. Our top  10 billionaires are doing fine. \u201cTheir collective wealth has soared 27 per cent since July this year,\u201d <em style=\"i\">The Times of India</em> told us on its front page  on October 8. The headline said they\u2019d got \u201cricher by $65.3 billion\u201d in just three months since July. That is, by more than Rs.119 crore an hour. Or not far from Rs.2 crore every minute. Of the 10, the TOI tells us, Mukesh Ambani alone \u201cincreased his wealth by roughly Rs.40 lakh every single minute.\u201d </p> <p>It is doubtful if the wages of agricultural labourers went up by just Rs.40 (just 40, not lakhs) in years, let alone by the minute. But then we rank fourth in super-rich and 128th in human development. Most of our billionaires seem to be from Mumbai, also home to a quarter of India\u2019s $100,000  millionaires. Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra, perhaps our richest State on many counts. One that has seen close to 32,000 farmers commit suicide since 1995. Also a State where rural poverty has gone up even in official reckoning. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the UNHDR records that almost a third of India\u2019s children, or 30 per cent, are below average weight at birth. In Sierra Leone, ranked at 177, rock bottom of the Human Development Index,  it is 23 per cent. In Guinea Bissau and Burkina Faso, ranked 175 and 176, children with low birth weight account for 22 and 19 per cent. Even in Ethiopia, ranked 169,  the figure is 15 per cent. So we\u2019re down there with the bottom five on that count. </p> <p>Amongst children under the age of five, 47 per cent in India are underweight. In Ethiopia, that is 38 per cent. And in Sierra Leone, 27 per cent. We are home to the largest number of malnourished children in the world. When it comes to child nutrition and literacy, we jostle for space with the nations ranked lowest in HDI in the planet. And mostly we even beat them. </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>This week\u2019s papers report a curious new development. One which might further impact on our \u2018rank.\u2019 They report a World Bank study as saying that the Indian and Chinese economies might be smaller in size than we believe. Maybe almost 40 per cent smaller, says <em style=\"i\">The International Herald Tribune</em> (December 9, 2007). \u201cWhat happened was a large statistical glitch,\u201d says the IHT. But it\u2019s a glitch that matters. \u201cSuddenly the number of Chinese who live below the World Bank\u2019s poverty line of a dollar a day jumped from about 100 million to 300 million.\u201d It turns out the overpaid elite number crunchers have been using obsolete data for a very long time. </p> <p>The Bank\u2019s own survey lists new purchasing power parities for 100 countries benchmarked for the year 2006. Well, India figured in the study for the first time since 1985 and China for the first time ever. And so? India\u2019s GDP in PPP terms, the TOI notes, was $3.8 trillion in 2005 before the new study. Going by the new data after the revision, it stands at $2.34 trillion. (In nominal dollar terms, roughly $800 billion.) Boy! These updated data are a nuisance. First it turns out we should have been HDI rank 128 last year, too. Now we learn that our economy is a lot smaller than we imagined. As the IHT says, \u201cThis is not a mere technicality.\u201d It shrinks the relative size of developing economies by quite a bit. India\u2019s GDP per capita (PPP) falls from $3,779 to $2,341 with the new data. Also, as the TOI sadly notes: \u201cWe ain\u2019t a trillion dollar economy yet.\u201d </p> <p>It is not clear yet how agencies other than the Bank, like the UNDP for instance, were working with PPP. Were they using updated measures or the old data? If the latter (which seems the case), and given India\u2019s entry in the Bank survey is recent, even our awful HDI performance could get worse. The captain has switched on the seat belt sign. Buckle up: we could be landing soon on the updated numbers. </p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p></p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font

But the word discrimination in terms of caste means something very different that the media mostly do not, or choose not to, understand.</p> <p align=\"justify\"></p> <p>A signal achievement of the Indian elite in recent years has been to take caste, give it a fresh coat of paint, and repackage it as a struggle for equality. The agitations in  the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences and other such institutions were fine examples of this. Casteism is no longer in defensive denial the way it once was. (\u201cOh, caste? That was 50 years ago, now it barely exists.\u201d) Today, it asserts that caste is killing the nation \u2014 but its victims are the upper castes. And the villains are the lower orders who crowd them out of the seats and jobs long held by those with merit in their genes. </p> <p>This allows for a happy situation. You can  practise casteism of a visceral kind \u2014 and feel noble about it. You are, after all, standing up for equal rights, calling for a caste-free society. Truth and justice are on your side. More importantly, so are the media. Remember how the AIIMS agitation was covered? </p> <p>The idea of \u201creverse discrimination\u201d (read: the upper castes are suffering) is catching on. In a curious report on India, <em style=\"i\">The Wall Street Journal</em>, for instance, buys into this big time. It profiles one such upper caste victim of \u201creverse discrimination\u201d with sympathy. (\u201cReversal of Fortunes Isolates India\u2019s Brahmins,\u201d Dec. 29, 2007.) \u201cIn today\u2019s India,\u201d it says, \u201chigh caste privileges are dwindling.\u201d The father of the story\u2019s protagonist is \u201cmore liberal\u201d than his grandfather. After all, \u201che doesn\u2019t expect lower-caste neighbours to take off their sandals in his presence.\u201d Gee, that\u2019s nice. They can keep their Guccis on.</p> <p>A lot of this hinges, of course, on what we like to perceive as privilege and what we choose to see as discrimination. Like many others, the WSJ report reduces both to just one thing: quotas in education and  jobs. No other form of it exists in this view. But  it does in the real world. Dalit students are routinely humiliated and harassed at school. Many drop out because of this. They are seated separately in the classroom and at mid-day meals in countless schools across the country. This does not happen to those of \u201cdwindling privileges.\u201d </p> <p>Students from the upper castes do not get slapped by the teacher for drinking water from the common pitcher. Nor is there much chance of acid being thrown on their faces in the village if they do well in studies. Nor are they segregated in hostels and in the dining rooms of the colleges they go to. Discrimination dogs Dalit students at every turn, every level. As it does Dalits at workplace.</p> <p>Yet, as Subodh Varma observes (<em style=\"i\">The Times of India</em>, December 12, 2006), their achievements in the face of such odds are impressive. Between 1961 and 2001, when literacy in the population as a whole doubled, it quadrupled among Dalits. Sure, that must be seen in the context of their starting from a very low base. But it happened in the face of everyday adversity for millions. Yet, the impact of this feat in terms of their prosperity is very limited. </p> <p>The WSJ story says \u201cclose to half of Brahmin households earn less than $100 (or Rs. 4,000) a month.\u201d Fair enough. (The table the story runs itself shows that with Dalits that is over 90 per cent of households.) But the journalist seems unaware, for example, of the report of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector. Which says that 836 million Indians live on less than Rs.20, or 50 cents, a day. That is, about $15 a month. As many as 88 per cent of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (and many from the Other Backward  Classes and Muslims) fall into that group. Of course, there are poor Brahmins and other upper caste people who suffer real poverty. But twisting that to argue \u201creverse discrimination,\u201d as this WSJ story does, won\u2019t wash. More so when the story admits that, on average, \u201c[Brahmins] are better educated and better paid than the rest of Indian people.\u201d </p> <p>Oddly enough, just two days before this piece, the WSJ ran a very good summary of the Khairlanji atrocity a year after it occurred. That story, from a different reporter, rightly suggests that the economic betterment and success of the Bhotmange family had stoked the jealousy of dominant caste neighbours in that Vidharbha village. But it ascribes that success to India\u2019s \u201cprolonged economic boom which has improved the lot of millions of the nation\u2019s poorest, including Dalits.\u201d Which raises the question: were other, dominant caste groups not gaining from the \u201cboom?\u201d How come? Were Dalits the only \u201cgainers?\u201d </p> <p>As Varma points out, 36 per cent of rural and 38 per cent of urban Dalits are below the poverty line. That\u2019s against 23 per cent of rural and 27 per cent of urban India as a whole. (Official poverty stats are a fraud, but that\u2019s another story.) More than a quarter of Dalits, mostly landless, get work for less than six months a year. If half their households earned even $50  a month, that would be a revolution.</p> <p>Let us face it, though. Most of the Indian media share the WSJ\u2019s \u201creverse discrimination\u201d views. Take the recent Brahmin super-convention in Pune. Within this explicitly caste-based meeting were further surname-based conclaves that seated people by clan or sub-group. You don\u2019t get more caste-focussed than that. None of this, though, was seen as odd by the media. Almost at the same time, there was another high-profile meeting on within the Marathas. That is, the dominant community of Maharashtra. The meeting flatly demanded caste-based quotas for themselves. Again, not seen as unusual. </p> <p>But Dalit meetings are always measured in caste, even racist, terms. This, although Dalits are not a caste but include people from hundreds of social groups that have suffered untouchability. The annual gathering in memory of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on December 6 in Mumbai has been written of with fear. The damage and risks the city has to stoically bear when the noisy mass gathers. The disruption of traffic. The threat to law and order. How a possible exodus looms of the gentle elite of Shivaji Park. (In fear of the hordes about to disturb their polite terrain.) And of course, the sanitation problem (never left unstated for it serves to reinforce the worst of caste prejudice and allows \u201cus\u201d to view \u201cthem\u201d as unclean). </p> <p>But back to the real world. How many upper caste men have had their eyes gouged out for marrying outside their caste? Ask young Chandrakant in Sategaon village of Nanded in Maharashtra why he thinks it happened to him last week. How many higher caste bastis have been torched and razed in land or other disputes? How many upper caste folk lose a limb or even their lives for daring to enter a temple? </p> <p>How many Brahmins or Thakurs get beaten up, even burnt alive, for drawing water from the village well? How many from those whose \u201cprivileges are dwindling\u201d have to walk four kilometres to fetch water? How many upper caste groups are forced to live on the outskirts of the village, locked into an eternal form of indigenous apartheid? Now that\u2019s discrimination. But it is a kind that the WSJ reporter does not see, can never fathom. </p> <p>In 2006, National Crime Records Bureau data tell us, atrocities against Dalits increased across a range of offences. Cases under the Protection of Civil Rights Act shot up by almost 40 per cent. Dalits were also hit by more murders, rapes and kidnapping than in 2005. Arson, robbery and dacoity directed against them \u2014 those went up too. </p> <p>It\u2019s good that the molestation or rape of foreign tourists (particularly in Rajasthan) is causing concern and sparking action. Not so good that Dalit and tribal women suffer the same and much worse on a colossal scale without getting a fraction of the importance the tourists do. The same Rajasthan saw an infamous rape case tossed out because in the judge\u2019s view, an upper caste man was most unlikely to have raped a lower caste woman. </p> <p>In the Kumher massacre which claimed 17 Dalit lives in that State, charges could not be framed for seven years. In a case involving a foreign tourist, a court handed down a guilty verdict in 14 days. For Dalits, 14 years would be lucky. Take contemporary Maharashtra, home to India\u2019s richest. The attention given to the Mumbai molestation case \u2014 where 14 arrested men remained in jail for five days after being granted bail \u2014 stands out in sharp contrast to what has happened in Latur or Nanded. In the Latur rape case, the victim was a poor Muslim, in Nanded the young man who was ghoulishly blinded, a Dalit. The Latur case was close to being covered up but for the determination of the victim\u2019s community. </p> <p>The discrimination that pervades Dalit lives follows them after death too. They are denied the use of village graveyards. Dalits burying their dead in any place the upper castes object to could find the bodies of their loved ones torn out of the ground. Every year, more and more instances of all these and other atrocities enter official records. This never happens to the upper castes of \u201cdwindling privileges.\u201d The theorists of \u201creverse discrimination\u201d are really upholders of perverse practice. </p> <p

Shankaran, covered 8,351 villages. That is, every farm household in every single village in the districts of Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Washim, Buldhana, and Wardha. Close to 10,000 government staff and workers went to the field for this massive 15-day effort that ended in June. From District Collectors down to Talatis, gramsevaks, and teachers at the village level, all were involved.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe survey found that more than half the 17 lakh farm families faced major problems due to debt. An equal number sought help with farm inputs that are now more and more hard to afford. Well over three lakh families had daughters whose marriages they could not arrange due to the financial crisis they faced. One in every nine showed interest in the mass marriage scheme of the Government.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNearly 70 per cent of the 17 lakh households are in \"distress due to crop failure or crop losses.\" Tens of thousands of farmers faced \"distress due to the problem of chronic diseases.\" That does not include those who face health problems other than chronic diseases. Only about a fifth of all households were found to be \"without any distress.\" Perhaps the one positive aspect thrown up is that more than 40 per cent have sought help to move towards organic farming.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe six districts are the ones covered under the Prime Minister's `relief package' announced soon after his visit to the region in June. All except Wardha fall into the Amravati Division. \"Look at the data and you see the sheer scale of the problem,\" says one officer who worked with the survey. \"You also see that the `packages' thrown up so far are peanuts.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nEmbarrassing data\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA single summary sheet of the survey's findings is up on the State Government's website. Some of the more detailed findings \u0097  not on the website \u0097  are with <i>The Hindu</i>. The data are an embarrassment to the State Government. Its leaders have claimed that factors other than debt and agrarian distress are behind the mounting farm suicides in the region. So much so that the State has been asking `spiritual leaders' to set up shop in Vidharbha to `counsel' the farmers. The Chief Minister was present at a meeting of one such group on Sunday. Some of these bodies have been actively raising funds. The stated aim, at least, is to help the distressed farmers. \"But how this will help them is anyone's guess,\" says Kishore Tiwari of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS). \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPosted on the same website, but not part of the survey, is the Government's own count of farm suicides. It admits to almost 2,400 of them in these six districts between 2001 and 2006. It also shows that this year has been by far the worst. By just November, the number had reached 1,215. For one thing, this is almost three times last year's official figure of 431. For another, it means that farm suicides in just the first ten months of this year were almost 25 times more than occurred in all of 2001. That year, the number was 49.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA thorough, documented analysis of this by senior officials \u0097  not on the website \u0097  plays down this number. It argues that half of these are \"non-agrarian distress\" deaths. Even so, the other 1,200 in itself makes a stunning figure. This is far higher than the numbers put up by either the media or by activists in the region. The State itself now reckons that in close to a thousand of these cases, debt was the major reason.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe website, too, says only about half the deaths are cases eligible for compensation. In short, the rest are not genuine cases of distress deaths. So the families Will get nothing. This section of the website exists because of a court order. So the numbers have to be posted and kept up to date. But they look awful. Hence the jugglery to make things seem better.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Government's figure of farm suicides is not merely larger than farm activist counts. It is for a much smaller region. The VJAS says 1,100 farmers have taken their lives since June last year in Vidharbha's 11 districts. The State's number for that period crosses 1,500 for just the six crisis districts. So the official figure is even larger than it seems.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe official report is quite candid on one point. It says: \"In spite of the PM's and CM's relief package implementation, the numbers of suicides in the six districts continue to be in the range of 100 per month.\" Still, the report finds a few things are better. It says the proportion of those killing themselves \"due to the agrarian crisis is showing a declining trend.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is more than one catch to that `declining trend.' There have never been 100 suicides a month prior to August this year. And that figure has been crossed every month since. So how is this a decline? The answer lies in the number of cases rejected by government as not eligible for compensation. This `rejection rate' has risen dramatically after the Prime Minister's visit. More and more deaths are excluded by the State as \"non-genuine.\" That is, claims for compensation are denied on the ground that these were not due to agrarian distress. Where less than 40 per cent of cases were rejected as \"not eligible\" last year, this year it is over 60 per cent. That is, close to 750 suicides this year are seen as not genuine. Which obviously brings down the `trend.'\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"They end up with such huge numbers even after so many cases are rejected,\" says Mr. Tiwari. \"And still their suicides figure is higher than our own. Think of what the real picture must be.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<web></web></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006112201731100.htm&amp;date=2006/11/22/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2006/11/22/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2006112205191000.htm\">A tenuous peace under strain</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112205181000.htm\">Countering an alarming trend</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112205171000.htm\">Future of the right wing, there and over here</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112201731100.htm\">It's official: distress up, suicides appalling</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112201721100.htm\">Music hits some controversial keys</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112201701100.htm\">Corrections and Clarifications</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112205161000.htm\">Sachar panel report</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112205161001.htm\">India's shame</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112205161002.htm\">Dealing with stress</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006112205161003.htm\">Friedman &amp;

The same week that Opposition parties staged mock funerals for farmers inside the Maharashtra Assembly, real funerals were held for more than 20 farmers who had committed suicide in those seven days. All of them driven to it by debt. Months after the `relief packages,' Vidharbha's crisis has gotten worse. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLarge numbers of police had been shifted to Nagpur by December 3. With the session to begin the next day \u0097  and a dozen protests planned outside the legislature \u0097  the force there was beefed up strongly. Khairlanji, of course, grabbed most of the attention. In the process, the problems simmering at the procurement centres across the cotton belt were sidelined. When things boiled over, as they were sure to, no one could cope.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe tension and clashes at the procurement centres were easy to predict. As reported in this newspaper, \"procurement delays could force many farmers to sell in distress to private buyers.\" ( <i>The Hindu</i> , November 25, 2006.) Being forced into the corner was what sparked off the clash that saw farmer Dinesh Ghugal lose his life. This time three years ago, there were around 300 cotton procurement centres at work. This year that number is 56. The farmers are being pushed towards private traders. And much lower prices. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe official price this season is between Rs.1,700 and Rs.1,900 a quintal. That's where the role of the cotton graders comes in. Farmers \u0097  often rightly \u0097  see the graders as serving trader interests. By placing their best produce in lower categories. So the price offered in practice falls even lower.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTo begin with, the Maharashtra Government brought down an already low cotton price last year by withdrawing the `advance bonus' till then paid to the farmers. That pushed the average price down from Rs.2,250 per quintal to just around Rs.1,700. It was clear then that an already stressed farm community would respond in despair. It was pointed out that the region \"could see a huge rise in the already dismal numbers\" of farm suicides. Which is what happened. ( <i>The Hindu</i>  October 28, 2005) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven if the price were Rs.2,250, the farmer would be selling at a loss. The State admits that the cost of production is far higher than what the growers are paid for their cotton. An official document puts this clearly. It says \"... the MSP fixed is about 20 to 30 per cent lower than the cost of production.\" The document is titled \"Farmers' Suicides in Maharashtra, an Overview.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarmers ran into much worse at the procurement centres this season. They found they could not get even the stated price of Rs.1,900. That's when trouble broke out. To date, a government that just a month ago announced a \"bumper crop\" has not procured even four lakh quintals of the 350 lakh quintal harvest it predicted. Farmers see that as a deliberate action. Aimed at pushing them into distress sales at abysmal prices. What's more, it's clear now there is no bumper crop. All that farmers at Wani were demanding was that the Government honour the promise that brought it to power in Maharashtra. A cotton price of Rs.2,700 a quintal. For this they were punished.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's odd that these actions come from a government that has admitted on record that some 10 million human beings \u0097  17.44 lakh farm families \u0097  in the region are in distress. Which also states on record that two million people among this lot are in what it terms \"maximum distress.\" Some of the details of mass misery in the six worst hit districts of the region are in that government paper on farm deaths. And also up on its own website. They come from the largest ever survey of its kind conducted by the government of Maharashtra. One that needed the services of close to 10,000 government workers and other staff.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYou'd think that findings like these would prompt the state to declare an agrarian emergency. Instead, most of last Saturday went in arresting people voicing that distress. Not even letting journalists know where those detained were being been held till their release hours later. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the main Opposition has failed to put the government on the mat. Their actions inside the House were based on drama, not debate. Gopinath Munde did articulate two or three major demands of the farmers. But too many of the BJP's MLAs seem to know little and care less about the dynamite the government's own data placed in their hands. So total is the disarray of the Sena-BJP that the Congress still won the by-elections in Vidharbha's Chimur and Daryapur Assembly seats. True, the candidates were both ex-Shiv Sainiks holding on to their personal turf. This time they just won on the Congress platform. But it gives us a glimpse of how badly the Opposition has failed to focus on the region's burning problems. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBoth ways, the State-wide debate has ranged mostly from the inane to the insane. One strange idea is that Vidharbha should move from cotton to sugarcane. It's amazing the notion persists even when Maharashtra is drowning in the latter. (Mr. Munde rightly attacked this.) The mills cannot handle all the cane there is. But for massive state support, sugar prices would plummet to Rs.12 a kg. Oddly, this action comes from a government that has withdrawn its intervention in cotton. As critics point out, this suggests cotton exists in the free market. Sugar, outside it. If there's one thing Maharashtra does not need more of, it is sugarcane. If there's one thing Vidharbha needs more of, it is water. Sugarcane could take up to 200 times the water that an acre of jowar does.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nU.S. subsidies\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDoes cotton exist in a free market? The State also admits that giant U.S. subsidies to that country's 20,000 cotton growers is hitting the millions of farmers in this region. Yet the Centre has not seen it fit to raise import duties. Which now stand at just ten per cent. And so India's cotton imports in seven years leading to 2005 were three times what they were in the preceding 25 years. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe U.S. cotton crop last year was worth around $3.9 billion. But that nation's handouts to its growers the same year totalled $4.7 billion. Such subsidies have sunk global prices. As a result, says the State Government's own paper, \"imported cotton now sells at Rs.17,000 a bale compared to Rs.19,000 a bale for Indian cotton.\" It also points out that in 2001-02, \"U.S. raw cotton exports to India more than tripled to over one million bales. And the U.S. share of total Indian imports rose from 20 per cent to 60 per cent.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA noble admission by the state. But others making the same point face possible arrest and false charges. Activists are being hauled up for the trouble in Wani. The Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti's leader Kishore Tiwari was among those held for some hours. He was not in Wani at the time of the trouble. In fact, the same man and his group now accused of sparking unrest were weeks ago widely covered in the media for practising non-violent `gandhigiri' at the region's hated banks. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo we now have a State Government that confesses in black and white to the very charges that farmers are making. But which resorts to force against those making the charges. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBoth State and Centre, though, stick to a stubborn public stance that things will improve. Once the `relief packages' begin to work, they insist, things will get a lot better. Yet, the State's own paper on farm suicides is candid about their progress. \"In spite of the PM's and CM's relief packages,\" it says, \"the numbers of suicides in the six districts continues to be in the range of 100 a month.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Maharashtra Government's own count for this year is more than 1,250 suicides. In just the six worst-hit districts. It admits to that figure but says more than half of these are `not genuine.' That is they will not get compensation. They were not due to distress. Every officer, though, knows better. They also know this has been the worst year ever. There have been over 450 in just the last four months. The first eight days of December saw 36. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith the death of Ghugal, things will hot up again as the session resumed this week. It appears the State Government could announce some measures aimed at curbing farm turmoil. There could even be some kind of payments to those in distress. But as two `relief packages' have shown, these will not achieve much if they do not also address the basic issues. That is, a fair price for cotton. A loan waiver. Improved credit. Support that helps lower input costs. A boost for food crop. Otherwise, the next session of the Assembly will be discussing the failures rising out of this one. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

Indeed, they haven't even got into them so far. And it's still a huge achievement. The 11 young people here will be the first women Foresters to come out of the Central Forest Rangers College in Chandrapur this March. (No longer `Central' since this rangers training college has been back with Maharashtra  for years now.) They are the first women to graduate from here.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThey are mostly girls from rural Maharashtra. From places such as  Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, and Yavatmal and not from the big cities. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's a huge advance and they know it. \"This is the only field where women were not there. Now they are,\" says Amrapalli Khobragade from Chandrapur. And they are quick to tell you \"there were 47,000 applicants for this course to become foresters. We made it.\" Of that giant pool of aspirants, only 524 were shortlisted. A mere 33 made the final cut including the women we are now talking to. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNot an easy task\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt wasn't easy. Among the many tests they went through was a 16-km walk. They did it, even Yogita, who comes under the 40 per cent disability group. It won't be easy when they get into the woods either. Theirs is a hundred per cent field job. Wildlife is just part of it. So is protection, conservation, and management of the forests. They will have to conduct raids, do night patrolling in jungles, take on poachers, the timber mafia, and other well-armed adversaries. They could even clash with gun-toting naxals in this region.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Yes, it is dangerous,\" says Amrapalli. \"But there is no place where there is no risk. We will meet that challenge.\" And, they point out, \"we've already been in such tasks while on field training.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThey will rank below Range Forest Officers (RFOs) who are gazetted officers. And above the Forest Guard. It takes 20 years for a Forester to become an RFO. (And an equal number of years for the Guard to hit Forester rank.) When confirmed by the Maharashtra Forest Department, they will earn around Rs.8,000 a month. Their educational background varies, with some of them still doing their B.A. And with a few, like Kushal Rangari, who is a B.E. (Electronics &amp; Telecom) from Yavatmal. There is Sheetal Gedam who has a Masters in Social Work from Chandrapur. And Surekha Dahikar, a civil engineer from Yavatmal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome are quite frank that if fields they are more interested in open up to them, they would go there. But while in this service, says Kushal, \"I would like to use my telecom and electronics background to the maximum.\" Others are here and intend to stay. They love the field. Three of the eleven are married.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is a strong common factor. All these young women speak proudly of liberal families. Particularly of supportive fathers. \"Girls in my community get married very early,\" says Lalita Suryavanshi. \"Many in our clan told my father \u0097  who is in the police \u0097  that it was ridiculous to let me go to the jungles. `She should have been married off by now.' they said. My father replied that looking at some of the young men around, I would be safer amongst the tigers.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOthers tell such stories, too. \"My father is an RFO in Sironcha,\" says Madhumati Tawde. \"As a very young girl, I saw him come back from dangerous raids. He had seized timber from gangs, fought armed poachers. Worked in naxal territory. It was exciting and I thought: I can do this, too. Otherwise, I would have been a teacher, I think.\" Amrapalli's father had \"no forest background. But he always told me I could do anything men did and do it better.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSeema Gore is married to a peon in the Forest Department. \"He went out and got the application form for me to fill out and encouraged me to do it,\" she says. \"I knew nothing about the forest. Today, I know that only one in a thousand applicants made it. It means a lot.\" They say College Principal S.P. Wadaskar is supportive and has helped them grow. He sees them as: \"Willing and good learners. They have shown character and strength.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNot all are so excited about the development, though. Some senior officers say \"This is the outcome of the government's policy of trying to get 30 per cent of women in all categories. Good in itself, but this is a field job in the jungle. And it may not be good for women.\" That some of the top police officers in the country who have seen very dangerous work are also women cuts no ice. However, there is a general acceptance even at this level that it's a step forward. The new foresters, anyway, don't waste time thinking about that. \"We don't want pity or sympathy,\" says Amrapalli. \"Nor office duty or `safe' chores. Watch us.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAll of them are conscious they will be seen as role models. \"During our field tour,\" says one, \"there was this constable telling his little daughter: `See those women? If you study well, you can also be one of them.'\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, in the jungle about two hours away, much lower down the ladder, is Kranti Naitam, a forest guard. She has been a `beat guard' inside the jungle. And is right now a `gate guard' at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve. Kranti is a Punjabi married to a Gond Adivasi who is also a forest guard. Her father came to this remote region as a Partition-era refugee nearly six decades ago. And has presided over inter-caste marriages for all his five children. On Kranti's turf no mobile phone works. There is no theatre nor television. No friends or relatives nearby to visit. The job of gate guard, she says, has been uneventful. As a beat guard earlier, she was part of a team that fought and arrested a gang that had killed a tiger. In short, she's done some of those jobs that `may not be good for women.' But it's a service that's changing.

They live in the same house in Tiroda, of course. It's the same with Buribai Nagpure \u0097  though she might sometimes see her older boy if he's awake. Both women are among hundreds in this part of Maharashtra's Gondia district who spend just four hours a day at home and travel over 1,000 km each week \u0097  to earn Rs.30 daily.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's 6 a.m. when we accompany the women from their homes to the railway station. Most have been up two hours already. \"I've finished the cooking, washing, sweeping and cleaning,\" says Buribai cheerfully. \"So now we can talk.\" No other member of her household is awake when we arrive. \"Poor things,\" she says, \"they're tired out.\" Isn't Buribai tired out, too? \"Yes, but what to do? We have no options.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt the station are many other women without options. They are also unusual in one sense: these are not migrants from village to city. They are footloose workers from an urban setting seeking work in the villages. This search takes them from moffusil towns \u0097  Tiroda is a tehsil headquarters \u0097  to toil as agricultural labour in the villages almost every day of their lives. Spending up to 20 hours away from home daily. There are no weekend offs and no jobs in Tiroda. \"After the beedi industry went,\" says Mahendra Walde, \"it is impossible for them to find work here.\" Mr. Walde is district secretary of the Kisan Sabha in Gondia.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany of the women live five or more kilometres from the railway station. \"So we have to be up by 4 a.m.,\" says Buribai. \"We finish all our work and walk to the station by seven.\" That's when the train comes in and we clamber on with the group that will go to Salwa in rural Nagpur. The 76-km journey takes two hours. On the platform and in the train are more women, weary-eyed, hungry, half-asleep. Most sit on the floor of the crowded train, leaning against the carriage wall, trying to snatch some sleep before their station arrives.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We will reach home at 11 p.m.,\" says Revantabai. \"We sleep by midnight. And start all over again at 4 a.m. the next morning. I have not seen my six-year-old awake in a long time.\" Then she laughs: \"Some of the much younger children may not recognise their mothers when they do see them.\" Their children have either dropped out of school because they cannot afford it. Or perform poorly there. \"There is no one at home to watch or help,\" points out Buribai. And some of the youngsters are themselves doing any work they find.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Naturally, they do badly at school,\" says Lata Papankar, a teacher based in Tiroda. \"Who can blame them?\" It appears the Government of Maharashtra can. The performance of these children is held against the schools, which might lose funds. And against teachers trying to help them, who might be penalised for poor results. An approach that will further erode their chances of going to school.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSeated on the rocking floor of the train, Shakuntalabai Agashe says she has been doing this for 15 years. The only breaks come during festivals or the monsoon. \"For some kinds of work,\" she says, \"we may be paid Rs.50. But that's rare. Mostly it's Rs.25-30.\" There are no jobs in their towns, say the women.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe money there is has flown to the cities. The industries there were have closed down. The moffussil towns are in decay. Almost all these women found work with the beedi industry in the past. \"When that went we were finished,\" says Buribai. \"Beedi is a footloose industry, ever in search of cheaper labour,\" says K. Nagaraj of the Madras Institute of Development Studies who has worked on the sector. \"It shifts base quite quickly. The human consequences of such shifts are devastating. And have gone up these past 15 years.\" A lot of beedi work \"has gone off from Gondia to Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh,\" says Pradeep Papankar of the Kisan Sabha. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Of course we do not buy tickets to travel on the train,\" the women say. \"A round ticket would cost more than the Rs.30 we earn. Our system is simple: if we get caught, we pay the checker a bribe of Rs.5.\" Ticket revenue has been privatised. \"They extort it from us knowing we can't afford it.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"My older boy drops me at the station on his cycle sometimes,\" says Buribai. \"Then he stays there looking for any work, whatever the pay. My daughter cooks at home. And my second boy takes the meal to his brother.\" In short, says Mr. Walde, \"three people are working for the wage of one.\" But all five family members together, including her husband, often make much less than Rs.100 a day. Some days, just two of them may have earned anything at all. They do not have a BPL ration card. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt stations along the way are labour contractors, waiting to pick up workers on the cheap.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nReaching Salwa around 9 a.m. we set out a kilometre to the village and a further three km into the fields. Buribai does that last stretch with a huge vessel of water perched on her head, yet outpaces all of us.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThose on whose fields they labour for a pittance are also in trouble. The agrarian crisis has hit landowner Prabhakar Vanjare badly. He owns three acres and has taken ten on lease. \"Prices are terrible, we earn almost nothing,\" he complains. And resident labour in the village has migrated elsewhere in despair. Hence the coming of these women.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis is eastern Vidharbha, away from the troubled cotton belt. Mr. Vanjare grows paddy, chilli, and other items. Right now, he just requires the women for weeding work. They work till about 5-30 p.m. and get back to the station an hour later.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"But the train only comes in by 8 p.m.\" points out Buribai. \"So we will reach Tiroda only around 10 p.m.\" Their families are asleep when the women get home. And asleep when they leave in the mornings. \"What family life can there be,\" asks Revantabai.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBy the time they reach home, they have travelled over 170 km. And will do that every day of the week \u0097  to earn Rs.30. \"We'll be home by 11 p.m.\" says Buribai, \"to eat and sleep.\" Until four hours later, when they have to get up and do it all over again. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

But the rest of the food was awful,\" says M. Nallappa Reddy. His brief sojourn behind bars has made this man in his Sixties a minor celebrity in this State. Not so much because he liked the tea in Kadapa jail. But because many see his experience as the revival of an ominous trend: the jailing of bankrupt farmers for debt in Andhra Pradesh.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"It happened before during the time of Chandrababu Naidu's government, it is happening again now. More aggressively,\" says Malla Reddy, general secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Ryuthu Sangham (APRS). \"Banks are turning the screws on hard-up farmers, sending them to jail. Mind you, these are farmers in drought-hit regions with no crop and no capacity to pay. The same banks won't touch big industrialist defaulters who owe them crores. But farmers owing a few thousand rupees go to jail.\" Till recently, the website of the A.P. Debt Recovery Tribunal listed some 200 names of VIPs, industrialists, contractors, and politicians owing over Rs.1,000 crore  to the banks. The money was not recovered but the site seems to have vanished.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I did try to repay,\" insists Mr. Nallappa Reddy. To clear the loan he took more loans at high interest rates from private lenders. \"The principal sum I owed the bank was Rs.24,000. I paid Rs.10,000 in court and went back to pay another Rs.24,000. I could not manage the Rs.1 lakh the Anantha Gramina Bank was demanding. How could we, after a decade of failure in agriculture? So I hoped they would accept the Rs.34,000 under the One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe bank did not accept the OTS deal. \"When I went to court last October to pay the Rs.24,000, I was remanded and sent to Kadapa jail.\" There, he says: \"I met at least six others in the same situation as I was. Two of them owed this same bank money.\" Many more were in line for arrest, he says, and believes the District Collector helped avert that \u0097  for now. \"Jail was interesting. One woman came to have her husband released. He was there on a charge she filed against him. A little boy beside me turned out to be there on an arrack case. My neighbour was a burglar.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCommon experience\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn other respects, Mr. Nallappa Reddy's story is the same as that of millions of other farmers. As input costs shot up and bank credit declined in the past decade, he incurred heavy losses. As \"water, electricity and other costs rose, things got worse.\" Then the water ran out. \"I sank 32 borewells in ten acres within four or five years. All of them failed.\" This mandal shot to fame in 2004 when, desperate for water, farmer Chandrashekar Reddy sank four borewells in a graveyard linking it to his fields with an 8-km pipeline. (July 18, 2004.) He has since died. Ironically, a couple of those wells now yield some water, after their owner has himself gone to the grave.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Nallappa Reddy is unusual, though, in one other way. He quit the lorry business in the 1970s, betting on agriculture. \"Then, the future seemed bright. I sold my lorry and was the first to start grape cultivation here in Thimmampetta village, on my family's 12 acres. Things were good till the '90s.\" But \"the last 15 years have crushed us. All government policies work against the farmer. All farmers here are in the same condition.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"His arrest was not such a simple issue. The media have played it up without looking at the bank's problems,\" says an exasperated M.R. Vani, branch manager of the bank here. After two mergers, it is now called \"The Andhra Pragati Gramina Bank.\" Mr. Nallappa Reddy, says Ms. Vani, \"was a long-time defaulter. Only after ten years of waiting did we file a suit against him. Yes, he did ask for a settlement, but with a tiny amount. We asked him to improve his offer as the then head office was unable to accept it. Meanwhile court proceedings took their own course and we could not stop that.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMs. Vani herself is otherwise quite sympathetic. \"Now also, recovery is a problem. There have been no rains, no income, extended drought. And no alternative source of income is there for the farmers. Which is why our bank is encouraging them in other directions, too. We must give agricultural loans, of course. But we also give loans that seek to create other income.\" She knows things are hard. \"We've brought down the number of defaulters like him in this branch by half. But there are still over 100 of them.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nPress coverage helped\r\n</font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMedia coverage following his arrest ensured Mr. Nallappa Reddy's early release. He was out in a week. Others were not so lucky. \"I spent a full month inside,\" says Gengi Reddy in Kadiri mandal. He too went to Kadapa central jail. \"That was in the time of Chandrababu Naidu's government. I too, tried for a settlement whereby I paid back both principal and more. I even offered them some of my six acres to sell and recover the money. But they [the Kadiri branch of the same bank] told me flatly: `we don't want your land. Only cash. You should go to jail.'\" He did. And has since sold off irrigated land to clear his debts.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This practice has now revived,\" says Mr. Malla Reddy. \"In Mahbunagar district, just two months ago, a Dalit farmer and an OBC farmer spent two weeks in jail. This time, the State Bank of India was involved. Again, drought-hit farmers with no ability to repay.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n They were only released when their families borrowed more money from usurers to pay off their bank debts. All those who have been to jail speak of meeting others in there for the same reasons.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Nallappa Reddy was more fortunate. \"His neighbours love him,\" says one of them. \"The publicity he got stopped a lot of us from also going inside.\" The question is: for how long? \"The banks are getting more forceful now, as you can see from the Telangana cases,\" says Mr. Malla Reddy. \"This matter can explode one day.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The government is not interested in us,\" says Sainath Reddy, a nephew of the man who sank borewells in the graveyard. \"They want corporate agriculture. We are a nuisance in the way. I tell you, those you wish well, ask them to stay away from agriculture. Don't even wish it on your enemies.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<web></web></p> <p align=\"justify\">

He did, on November 28 in Panderkauda, Yavatmal. Ten days later, Dinesh Ghughul was shot dead by the police at the Wani cotton market in the same district. And Pundalik Girsawle walked into the premises of the agricultural officer, Wani, and killed himself there 12 days after Ghughul's death.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nKuchankar was 27, Ghughul was 38, and Girsawle 45. Different people in several ways. Yet they represent the same new \u0097  and growing \u0097  trend in Vidharbha's farm deaths. More and more such farmers are directly blaming state policy \u0097  not drought or floods \u0097  for their misery. Some confront the Government in tragic ways. Where Girsawle and Kuchankar chose to commit suicide was in itself a statement. And for some months now, the suicide notes of farmers are talking directly to Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and even to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Don't blame my family for my action,\" says the suicide note of young Kuchankar. \"I will never forgive anybody who does.\" He perhaps foresaw a standard government explanation of farm suicides: \"family dispute.\" And in one poignant sentence, addresses the 19-year-old girl he had wed just six months ago: \"Pratibha, I am sorry. Please get remarried.\" He blames the procurement price for cotton as the source of farmers' distress. \"We are fed up with the delay in procurement and crashing prices. This will further aggravate the situation.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHis message to Mr. Deshmukh: \"Mr. Chief Minister give us the price.\" And to Home Minister R.R. Patil \"if you do not give us a price of Rs.3,000 per quintal, suicides will surge.\" Kuchankar wrote: \"The cotton price has fallen to Rs.1,990 a quintal. We cannot manage with that. Which is why I am giving up my life.\" The suicide note is a bunch of anguished scribbles across a sheet of paper.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPundalik Girsawle chose the Agricultural Office in Wani to make his point. He was seeking Rs.4,800 to buy a bullock cart under the Prime Minister's relief package. He had seen four years of crop failure. His home being close to the Tejapur forest, wild animals devastated his fields. Household health expenses were rising. He sought the agricultural officer's aid.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"He went to that office 15 times,\" his mother Parvatabai told us in Tejapur. \"Look, he even sold one of the doors he had bought for this house. Why? To pay for his frequent bus tickets to Wani. But someone there demanded a bribe. When he threatened to commit suicide, they told him `you do what you like.' He was shattered.\" He chose that very office as the site of his suicide.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nRacket exposed\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNeighbours allege that the cheque for some Rs.4,400 found on his body \"was planted there to cover up the racket his suicide exposed.\" His five-member family now depends on the Rs.30 his widow Sunita brings in on those days she can find work. \"What happens to Pundalik's three daughters,\" asks Parvatabai. They are aged 14, 12, and 10. Meanwhile, officials declared it a \"non-distress\" suicide. A view echoed in sections of the media that had never been to the village or met his family.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"There is no way the government can record these two as farm suicides,\" says Kishore Tiwari of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti. \"Acceptance would highlight their words and actions \u0097  which directly implicate and expose the government and its policies. Hence they have to be called fake and the families denied compensation.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn August the suicide note of cotton grower Ramakrishna Lonkar in Wardha district had made news. \"After the Prime Minister's visit and announcements of a fresh crop loan, I thought I could live again,\" Lonkar wrote. But, he concluded, he found nothing had changed on the credit front. Or on other policies. The same month saw Sahebrao Adhao of Amravati district paint a picture of usury, debt, and land-grab in his suicide note. Yet again, a victim had captured the failure of both system and policy in writing.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This trend now causes huge trouble for the government,\" says Mr. Tiwari. \"All the cover-ups and paid-for bogus `studies' finding other causes for the deaths are destroyed when the farmer explains in detail why he is killing himself. And points a finger at the government's wrong policies.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDinesh Ghughul's case is more complex. \"He was not part of the protests that burst out in Wani that day,\" says his widow Savita at their home in Mendoli village. Huge delays in cotton procurement angered farmers. Just 56 procurement centres were at work where there had been 300 three years ago. In the chaos that followed, Ghughul fell to police bullets. \"He went to Wani to sell his cotton. Why kill him for that,\" she asked Mr. R.R. Patil. \"He told me, `what has happened has happened. But now let us help you and your family.'\" The huge public anger meant this family got some compensation for the loss of its bread-winner. But it is in bad shape. And it has only an APL card. The family feels the protest that led to his death was a statement. That it captured his own plight even if he was not part of it.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarmers' suicides in Vidharbha go on relentlessly. The first three weeks of this month have seen over 50. The State Government's own website has conceded over 1,400 suicides in just six districts of the region during 2006. However, the figures are kept down by increasing, each month, the \"rate of rejection\" of suicides. That is, the government argues that most of these suicides are not due to agrarian distress but \"other causes.\" Such as family disputes, drunkenness, and the like.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRejecting most of the deaths as \"not eligible\" for compensation helps \"slow down\" the number of suicides. On paper at least. The VJAS points out that the \"rejection rate\" has risen every month since the Prime Minister's visit last June. \"And yet,\" says Mr. Tiwari, \"the suicides go up. Just look at their own total figure.\" The Government's website concedes \u0097  on the basis of the biggest ever survey done in Vidharbha \u0097  that around 10 million farmers are in distress in these six districts. And that nearly two million are in \"maximum distress.\" That distress is showing. And the farmers taking their own lives are making no secret of who they blame for it.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

He could not take it any more, he told us. A farmer's life was not worth living. It was pretty cold by this time. Yet no one budged and you could feel the tension in the air. The play is called <i>atma hatya</i> (suicide) and we were part of an audience of 6,000 watching transfixed at that late hour. Theatre may be struggling to survive in the metros, but here in rural Vidharbha, it thrives. This is the season of <i>jhadi patti rang bhoomi</i>. Which loosely translates as \"theatre of the jungle belt.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEverybody is part of it. \"We have farmers, tailors, painters and vendors in our plays,\" says Ghulam Sufi of the Venkatesh natya mandali that is staging <i>Atma Hatya</i>. \"That's one reason why it resonates so much with ordinary people.\" Mr. Sufi plays tabla for the 60-member troupe. We watched him do that \u0097  and saw him dash off in between to don make up and do a swift cameo in the play. The main carpenter of the troupe whom we had seen at work earlier also made an appearance on the rotating stage he had set up that afternoon.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>Jhadi patti</i> is quite different from the mainline Marathi theatre of Mumbai and Pune. Nor is it part of the folk theatre of other parts of Maharashtra. It is rooted in just four districts of eastern Vidharbha, all of them forested. <i>Jhadi patti</i> has a history of over a century. \"See our audiences,\" says a proud Sadanand Borkar in Nawagaon, Chandrapur district. That's where the play is now being staged. Nawagaon alone has three seasoned troupes. The region has hundreds. Mr. Borkar is the author, director and also an actor in <i>Atma Hatya</i>. \"Our troupe, the Venkatesh natya mandali, is 110 years old this year.\" And his family were its founders.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are occasional blips with little local troupes not as trained as the Venkatesh mandali. Applause when an actor faints from exhaustion and not the script. Or the curtain guy falls asleep and fails to bring it down. It takes nothing away from the experience, though.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEarlier in the day, we watched people pour in from other villages to buy tickets. A striking feature of <i>jhadi patti</i> is the absence of sponsors. No boards announcing the generosity of a cola. No thanks to kind corporate patrons. The plays begin around 9.30 p.m. <i>Atma Hatya</i> will end only around 2 a.m. Others go on till even later.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We exist because of the people,\" says Mr. Borkar. \"Our plays are from their lives. They have high standards. `Faltu natak' or excessive vulgarity won't pass. Two years ago, angry people smashed one outside group's pandal on this count.\" In its first phase, <i>jhadi patti</i> had mythological themes. Then came period plays. During this time, scripts written in Mumbai and Pune were simply performed locally by visiting troupes. Now stage actors from Mumbai and Pune figure in plays written here. Mostly, the outside actors are women. \"Not so many women have taken to acting here as yet,\" says Mr. Borkar.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>Atma Hatya</i> has two outside professionals. The vastly experienced Rajini Bhatt from Pune. And Kanchan Mitkar, a bright young professional based in Nashik. Both speak highly of <i>jhadi patti</i>'s discipline and uniqueness and above all, its audiences. \"If you work here you have the confidence to work anywhere else,\" says Ms. Bhatt. The costliest ticket is Rs. 60 and entitles you to a chair. The lowest, Rs. 20 or less.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere may be no sponsors (and no one seems to be looking for any), but <i>jhadi patti</i> is a thriving small industry. \"It has no government support either,\" says Mr. Borkar who is also the Principal of a local Fine Arts college. <i>Jhadi patti</i>'s calendar ties in well with the agricultural cycle. \"Around or just after harvest when people have some money in hand and time to relax. That's when we function. We begin around diwali and wind up the season by April.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis uniquely eastern Vidharbha theatre gives full-time work to some the year round. And employment for thousands each season. Its turnover is a few crores of rupees. During the off-agriculture season, it earns a livelihood for labourers, tailors, carpenters and the like. It costs up to Rs. 80,000 to stage a play at big centres. And about half that in the smaller villages. The nearby town of Wadsa boasts a whole poster and pamphlet sector based on theatre work. It also supplies troupes on demand to the villages. Professionals from Mumbai or Pune could earn up to Rs. 3,000 a night acting in <i>jhadi patti</i>.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPeople have come to see <i>Atma Hatya</i> from within a 100-km radius. There is a further social side to it, too. \"They might come from 15 villages,\" says Mr. Borkar. \"There will meetings, contacts, and match-making. Weddings could be fixed here tonight.\" <i>Atma Hatya</i>'s perspective on farm suicides is from east Vidharbha and thus from outside the dismal cotton belt. But it does see debt as a driving factor. And it also captures other stresses. Such as the inner-family drama linked to changing lifestyles and interests as some members move away from farming. The family is crucial to <i>jhadi patti</i>.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe play's message is positive. Suicide is no solution. Fight the idea in your homes. An earlier Borkar play that broke records \u0097  <i>I killed my husband</i> \u0097  fought superstition. Some villages have used a play's proceeds to give soft loans to farmers. Others to get some work done locally. For the last two decades, <i>jhadi patti</i> has taken on social and political themes with a strong accent on justice. (Election year has local politicians scrambling to be seen on stage.) Now the region's farm suicides are under the spotlight.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This is Maharashtra's most unique theatre form,\" says Professor Pramod Mungate of the St. Francis de Sales college in Nagpur. Professor Mungate, who heads the Marathi department there, is studying <i>jhadi patti</i> on a University Grants Commission project. \"In Nagpur, only big names draw us to a play. In eastern Vidharbha, there will be nine plays held at Kurud village on February 9 simultaneously. They will all have big audiences for mostly part-time actors. <i>Jhadi patti</i>'s appeal has not shrunk despite the coming of multiple television channels. It's truly a people's movement, rooted in their lives. No sponsors or commercial patrons. This has audience. This has response. This is theatre.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

That's if the data of the National Crime Records Bureau are anything to go by. Strictly speaking they are not, being gross under-estimates. They draw from local machinery, which from region to region leaves out thousands from the lists of farm suicides. Yet, they still present a clear trend \u0097  a painful one. Even these twisted numbers show that farm suicides went up from 1,083 in 1995 to 3,836 eight years later. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor one thing, these figures are for all of Maharashtra. Which means if we were looking at just Vidharbha or Marathwada, the rise would be more horrendous. For another, these regions saw their greatest spurt in farm suicides after 2003 \u0097  where the last available NCRB data stops. The government of Maharashtra admits to 1,447 farm suicides in 2006 alone. And that's in only six districts of Vidharbha. So just these six districts saw far more suicides in 2006 than the whole State did in 1995. That's if we give credence to official readings of the data.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEvents on the ground confirm the trend, if not the accuracy of the data. Nine women turned widows on International Women's Day in Vidharbha. That's how many farmers took their lives on March 8. The highest on a single day in the region's recent history. Till two weeks later, when it happened again. There have been some 250 farm suicides in just the first three months of this year. Things could be a lot worse after June. And, as always, the farm suicides are a symptom of the crisis, not its cause. They are its outcome, not its engine.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nJust months from now, Vidharbha could see its first 100 per cent Bt cotton season. Bt cotton accounted for over 60 per cent of acreage last season. As acreage under it rises, so do the risks taken by the farmer. The Maharashtra government admits Bt cotton has fared very poorly in rain-fed regions. And it's clear that the seed companies might market much less of hybrid varieties in the coming season, if they do that at all. Why sell hybrid when there's more money to be made in Bt cotton? So even as many, including the National Commission on Farmers, call for making Vidharbha \"an organic farming zone,\" the reverse process is in full swing. Even apart from its report, the NCF chairperson, Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, pressed the government of Maharashtra on the notion of an organic zone. But the State's own seed corporation is a major distributor for Bt cotton. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis gets more worrying when you look at the record of the last few years. The government began the last season's harvest with boasts of a \"record\" 350 lakh quintal \"bumper crop.\" The claim was made by the State's Minister of Marketing, Harshvardhan Patil. And this grand success was swiftly credited to Bt cotton in some media reports. As the run of events punctured these claims, the figure was scaled down more than once. This is further confirmed by how little of cotton the official agencies have procured. For all of them together, the figure has not crossed 70 lakh quintals. And private traders are believed to have picked up around 110 lakh quintals. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn short, less than 180 lakh quintals. And this in a time of distress when the numbers should have been much higher, when farmers would have been desperate to sell. It means production could not have topped 220 lakh quintals, and could well have been less. Consider that in the `non-Bt cotton year' of 2003, procurement alone was over 210 lakh quintals. Production was far higher, at close to 250 lakh quintals. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis equation shows how high the risks are in the coming season. Vidharbha did better in a `non-Bt cotton year' than during one in which more than 60 per cent of the acreage was under Bt cotton. The State government's own report informs us that in preceding seasons too, \"In rain-fed conditions, Bt cotton has not paid good returns.\" And 97 per cent of cotton grown in Maharashtra is unirrigated. Here's the nub: a poor monsoon could make the earlier crisis seasons look like the good old times. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere's more irony to the vanished `bumper crop.' It has in fact been so hard to find that cotton prices are better than we've seen in a long time. In some places, they are as high as Rs.2,400 a quintal. At Rs.1,500 a quintal, soybean too is getting a better deal than before. Well, go easy on the cheers. It means that most farmers will go back to these crops again. The present prices, though still not good enough for cotton, will prove tempting. True, some people have turned to other crops. And it would be a good thing, further, if even cotton growers reserved an acre of their lands for jowar. That would give their families some security. But this is not happening on any large scale. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhen they return to cotton months from now, it will be to a Bt cotton-saturated season. Input prices will be higher. And yes, they will still use lots of pesticides. And the credit crunch will be far worse. Farmers are already figuring out the high cost of low interest loans. To begin with, very few had access to these six per cent interest loans. Those not repaying their sums by March 31 are out of the loop. Since not more than 20 per cent of them can do that, it means that farmers will be facing the old, higher rates again, very soon. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince there has been no loan waiver, most will be unable to access the credit they need from the banks. So it's back to the new loan sharks: the input dealers, the sellers of seed, the fake finance companies. The more this happens, the more the dealers will determine the inputs the farmers use. And, as an official report put it, for Bt cotton, \"the yields have been unstable.\" ( <i>The Hindu</i> , November 25, 2006). \"When farmers invest heavily in purchasing seeds and other inputs, the net return has often been negative.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat's more, there is nothing to suggest that the present cotton prices will rule next season. Not a step has been taken towards a price stabilisation fund. That would have made a big difference. But it's another NCF recce that bites the dust. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith things that serious, you'd expect a sense of urgency in the government. True, a handful of officers have on their own made efforts to study and measure the crisis. As a government \u0097  not a thing has changed. The Prime Minister's package is a shambles. The Chief Minister's efforts consist of contacting more Babas and Ammas for the spiritual salvation of the Vidharbha farmer. Salvation comes at a price. Which could translate into a number of these godmen being gifted prime pieces of real estate worth crores of rupees in due course. Their agents are already out scouting for the best locations, which they will then ask the government for. The business end of spirituality has always been deeply rooted in terra firma.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIf anything in this mess occupies the government's mind at all, it is the mounting numbers of suicides. These do not constitute the crisis in itself. But they are a great tragedy and bad publicity. And a huge embarrassment to the extent this government can experience that emotion at all. So the state get ever more creative. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe number of suicides in six Vidharbha districts gets worse. So how do we bring them down? By upping the `rejection rate' of such suicides. Surely we are the only country in the world that has a category called `eligible suicides.' (As distinct, say, from eligible bachelors or the like.) This term refers to those cases the state deems are `real' farmers suicides. This means the affected families will get some compensation. It does not matter that the rest \u0097  the ineligible \u0097  are just as dead. Or that their families suffer no less.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOne government report records that the \"number of cases reported\" in the six districts in 2002 was 105. In 2006, that number was 1,447. That's an increase in farm suicides of over 1,300 per cent in cases reported in five years. But while 69 per cent of the cases in 2002 were found `eligible' for compensation, just 40 per cent of last year's cases were found `eligible.' So more and more farmers are killing themselves. But fewer of these deaths will be counted as `farmers suicides.' In 2006, this rejection rate rose sharply almost every month of the year. For instance, 60 suicides were found `not eligible' in January last year. In October the same year, the rejected cases were 120. Ever growing numbers are rejected in this desperate bid to dilute the bad news. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSimply put, what's rising fastest in Maharashtra is self-delusion. We could see big trouble from May-June onwards. Which could be terrible by Diwali time if the monsoon emulates the State and Central governments in its functioning. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

It's all she can get. So she labours, sometimes for 12 hours, for Rs.25 worth of jowar. This is apart from slogging on her own four-and-a-half acres whenever she can. When her crop does succeed, she mostly loses it to wild animals as her farm is on the edge of the jungle. The better her cotton and soybean, the more wild boars and Nilgai it attracts. Fencing the farm would cost Rs.1 lakh. Money she can't dream of.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nKamlabai is one of over 100,000 women who have lost their husbands to farm suicides in India's agrarian crisis since the mid-1990s. She lives in the worst-hit zone: Vidharbha. Her village Lonsawla is located in Wardha, one of the six districts in the region that have together seen more than 6,000 farm suicides since 2001. Her husband Palasram, bogged down in debt, took his life a year ago. She has pulled on, trying to run their farm, living in a house with its roof half gone and two walls about to cave in again. This tiny ramshackle residence is home to five human beings. That includes her son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. In society's eyes, Kamlabai is a \"widow.\" In her own, she's a small farmer trying to make a living and support her family.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHow did a landless Dalit come to own a farm at all? The same way she keeps it going. Every moment of Kamlabai's life has been a struggle. She began as an agricultural labourer on a daily wage of Rs.10-12. \"That bought a lot more in those days,\" she says, of a time nearly four decades ago. To this, she added a little bit by collecting and selling fodder to farmers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I remember how my mother trudged for hours to collect chara [fodder] and sell it for next to nothing,\" says her son Bhaskar who is central to her plans to keep their farm afloat. \"I got ten paisa per penda [fistful],\" she laughs. \"But I made so many trips for it, I could make up to ten rupees daily from the chara.\" That is, she walked more kilometres than she could count to fetch and sell one hundred pendas of fodder each day. Her 16-18 hour workdays paid off, though. From these pathetic earnings she and her husband saved and bought land no one else would at the edge of the forest. That was nearly 40 years ago. She paid Rs.12,000 for four and a half acres. The family then worked like galley slaves to cultivate a very difficult farm. \"I had another son, too, but he died.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nKamlabai walks long distances even today, in her mid-60s. \"What to do? The farm is six kilometres away from our village. I earn as a labourer when I find work. And then I go to the farm to help Bhaskar and Vanita.\" She is too old to find work on government project sites. And on those, anyway, exist huge prejudices against lone women in general and widows in particular. So she takes any work she finds.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBetween them, the family have nurtured the farm. It looks good and productive. \"See this well,\" she points to a rather large one created by mostly family labour. \"If only we could get it cleaned and repaired, we'd have much more water.\" But that would need Rs.15,000 at least. And that's apart from the Rs.1 lakh that fencing the field would cost. They could convert one acre to a water body at the bottom of a slope on their land. That would mean even more money. Bank loans are now impossible. And proper repairs to her crumbling house would cost another Rs.25,000. \"My husband killed himself because of crop loss leading to debt of Rs.1.5 lakh,\" she says. They've paid off bits of that and the family has run through most of the Rs.1 lakh compensation she got from the State. But creditors still trouble her. \"We were doing alright. But then agriculture really failed for several years and we suffered big losses.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLike millions of others, her family was hit by the biggest agrarian crisis in decades. Rising input costs, falling output prices, lack of credit, withdrawal of State support. \"It's the same with everyone else in the village, too,\" she says. Last year brought crop disaster as well. She lost hugely, with Bhaskar betting on Bt cotton. \"All we got was two quintals,\" she says.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Government then added to the damage. Late last year, it made her a \"beneficiary\" of a \"relief package.\" Under this, Kamlabai was made to buy a costly \"aadha Jersey\" (half Jersey) cow she did not want. Though heavily subsidised, she still had to pay her share of Rs.5,500 for it. \"The brute ate more than all of us put together,\" she told us. (<i>The Hindu</i>, Nov. 23, 2006). And \"it yielded very little milk.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nReverse rental\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince then, \"I have twice given away the cow, but they always bring it back,\" she says with resignation. Those she gifts it to return it saying \"we cannot afford to feed it.\" So now \"I am paying a neighbour Rs.50 a month to look after the animal.\" A kind of reverse rental. The deal being that if the cow starts giving milk as it should, she will get a half-share. That belongs to an optimistic future. Right now, Kamlabai is paying to take care of a cow the Government promised would take care of her.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut her spirit is as yet unbroken. She still makes that long walk to the farm every day she does not find work. Today her tiny but energetic grandchildren make a slightly comical picture alongside her on the trail. Their survival and future is her biggest motivator. As always, her head is held high, but she can't hold back the tears when she looks at them. Kamlabai has decided that suicide is not about the dead. It's about the living.

All her married daughters are as poor as she is and cannot afford hospital costs. So she's done the job herself. There are 10 persons staying at her home when we visit. Besides looking after all of them, she runs a failing nine-acre farm and also works on the land of others for Rs.30 a day. In the off-season, like now, she earns just Rs.20 from fetching and selling firewood. Her last source of income is the milk from a buffalo she owns.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nShe's managed, she says, to get her fourth daughter married without expense. And is now trying to see if she can conduct the wedding of the fifth \"without spending too much.\" Kalavati is the mother of seven girls and two boys in Jalka village of Yavatmal district in Vidharbha. She is also one of over a lakh of women farmers across the country who have lost their husbands to farm suicides in the past 14 years.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNo compensation\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I never got a paisa's compensation from government,\" says this ever-smiling, matter-of-fact grandmother. The reason: the land they cultivate is not their own but leased from others. So when her husband Parsuram \u0097  hit by debt and crop failure \u0097  took his life, his death was recognised as a suicide, but not as a \"farmer's suicide.\" The official logic: if there's no land in his name, he's not a farmer. The family, though, has received some help from the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nParsuram's debt of over Rs.50,000 led him to even \"mortgage my mangalsutra. What could he do? This agricultural crisis raised all our costs.\" It didn't help, though. Their nine acres yielded just four quintals that fetched Rs.7,000. The day he sold his cotton, he redeemed his wife's mangalsutra with the money, went out to the field and killed himself. Kalavati, always a breadwinner, decided to carry on. \"Farming is what we do,\" she says, without a trace of self-pity. \"We'll keep doing it.\" She's worked and paid off most of his debts. She settled a loan from the local input dealer without paying interest. \"Now we owe only Rs. 15,000 to relatives and there's no interest involved.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"No. I'm not a member of any Self-Help group. I cannot afford the Rs.20 a month it takes.\" Four of her girls are married. Three before Parsuram took his life. But one is estranged from her husband and has returned home. And three others have come back to her for their deliveries.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"My daughter Maltha and I,\" she says, \"are the only earning members here.\" Between them, they make Rs.40 a day from the tiring task of gathering and selling firewood in this period.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe buffalo's milk fetches the rest of the income. \"Rs.60-80 a day. Sometimes a little more.\" On these earnings, some ten human beings exist. Maltha is the eldest at 25, Chaitanya the youngest at 8. Despite the hardship, it's a smiling if very noisy household ruled by lively youngsters. Most of her own children, of course, dropped out of school long ago.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nKalavati does not maintain the buffalo herself. \"That would cost more than we earn.\" Instead, she pays Rs.40 a month \u0097  or less than Rs.2 a day \u0097  to a professional herder for whom \"the animal is just one of dozens he looks after daily. And I share the dung with the rakhwala.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nFragile system\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis is an animal the family bought on its own. It is not part of the bizarre government scheme that has bankrupted many small farmers by saddling them with costly cows they do not want and cannot feed. So far, her system works but is most fragile. Any damage to the buffalo would shatter the family's economy. Right now: \"we sell all the milk.\" Even the kids at home don't get to consume a drop of it. And two other daughters who could work, can't do so right now because they've just borne children.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We've found a good alliance for our fifth girl, Lalita,\" she says. \"The boy's family has kindly not asked us for money. But they want us to host a proper lunch here. Or go to their village \u0097  which is even costlier. Well, we'll have to do something.\" She probably will. Even when Parsuram was alive, Kalavati managed to get two daughters, Savita and Sunita, \"married on the same day on the same pandal. After Maltha's wedding cost us over Rs.1 lakh, we had to save money somehow.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nShe's annoyed at not being recognised as a farmer and thereby losing out on the compensation. \"We do own 3.5 acres in Chandrapur district,\" she says. \"But that land is still in our parents' names and has not yet been settled in our names.\" So technically, they are not `farmers.' Here, \"we pay just Rs.10,000 a year to lease these nine acres. That tells you how poor its quality is,\" she laughs. It's hard work, but Kalavati wastes no time moping. What bothers her is \"it's been tough finding work since the Pola festival.\" And also: \"the costs of inputs are rising too much. No more cotton for us. We have to do something else.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nKalavati is one survivor who asserts that she would like her children too, to go into agriculture. This is rare in a countryside where people desperately seek jobs outside farming for their young. But she's already planning for the next season. \"We'll stay with agriculture,\" she says. \"It's what we do.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p>

She lives not far from where President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will visit on June 15. Her husband Ramdas was the first farm suicide case in Vidharbha to be highlighted in the media, way back in 1998. Since then she has faced years of pressure from his creditors to repay his loans. So it was surprising that the bank recovery men had let up.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Kishor Bhau gave me a letter which I showed them the last time they were here,\" she says. \"After that, they stopped coming.\" Even stranger. Kishor Tiwari is the president of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS) and the region's foremost agitator on farm issues. Hardly a friend of the banks, given the countless times he has gheraoed and badgered them on farm loan problems. So what did his letter say?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRoughly translated, it read: \"Dear Recovery Officers, Ramdas has appeared before me more than once from Heaven. He says: `I have the money and am waiting to repay you.' Please rush your team to Heaven. Yours sincerely, Kishor Tiwari.\" After that, says Saraswati, the team never showed up again.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Tiwari's open letter this week to President Kalam is more polite. It begs him to \"spare a few minutes to meet the unfortunate widows of farmers either at Yavatmal or Wardha.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThose and Nagpur are the places the President will touch during his day-long visit. His trip takes him to an event at Amolakchand College in Yavatmal. Also to the Mahatma Gandhi Hindi International University in Wardha. It does not so far include any agrarian distress-related meetings.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nIssue of cotton prices\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYavatmal, where the President's main function is, remains one of the most dismal parts of Vidharbha, the region hardest hit by the farm crisis. \"This year alone, there have been 428 farmers' suicides in Vidharbha,\" points out Mr. Tiwari. \"Unless urgent action is taken on cotton price, on debt and credit \u0097  it will be our worst year ever.\" And that would be something. The Government officially admits to 1,296 farm suicides due to the \"agrarian distress\" last year. It records a further 1,348 farm suicides in the same six districts the same year, but denies they were due to agrarian distress.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYavatmal is one of six districts in this region that together have seen more than 6,000 farm suicides since 2001. Saraswati is among more than 100,000 women across the country who have lost their husbands to suicides driven by the agrarian crisis since the mid-1990s. There are hundreds like her in Yavatmal alone. But her home has seen many VIP visits over the years, including that of Narayan Rane when he was Revenue Minister in the Shiv Sena Government. The compensation of Rs.1 lakh she got was long ago wiped out by debt.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We're spending Rs.30,000 on my daughter Meenakshi's illness,\" she says. (Another daughter died in 2004.) \"We've sold off several acres and some cattle over these years to cope. But farming gets costlier and more difficult.\" Yet she sees few options and keeps at it, hoping things will turn around.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Pisgaon village of the same district Varsha Rasse grabs any work she gets, no matter how poorly paid it is. For two seasons her husband Maruti had leased out their eight acres \u0097  throwing in his own labour as part of the deal. \"He had to get his sisters married,\" neighbours told us, \"and farming was collapsing.\" Then, with his own cultivation hit by excessive rains, Rasse committed suicide in 2004. His debt remains a problem for Varsha and their son and daughter are both under five years of age.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"They work harder and harder, and might produce more, but it only gets worse,\" says Vijay Jawandia, the region's foremost intellectual on agriculture. \"All these farmers are fighting impossible odds. The most basic issues have not been touched. They are widows because of indebtedness. The cost of living is rising, so are farming costs. Only their income goes down.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The Prime Minister's package helped some get fresh loans, but they got no help with the old ones. So now their debt has doubled. The central issue of price has never been addressed by the government. Nor has the issue of huge subsidies in the West for cotton producers there. So prices collapsed and these farmers cannot recover the cost of production. The new debt destroys their creditworthiness. So the banks will not touch them this season. Which pushes them back to moneylenders.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnnapurna Suroshe would agree with him. \"We've paid off all our debts from the compensation,\" she says in Nageshwadi village, \"but it doesn't end.\" It hasn't for her, with two boys and a girl to put through school. When the lease ends on the four acres her husband Rameshwar let out before killing himself last year, she wants to cultivate them herself. \"I might as well put in my labour on our own land.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Meanwhile, she's trying to run things from the Rs.25 a full day's labour now fetches her.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMangalabai Mokhadkar in Rampur \u0097  from the only Brahmin farm household seeing such a suicide \u0097  has held out longer. In the nine years since her husband Prabhakarrao committed suicide, she's got three of her eight daughters married. Some were married before his death. \"No dowry,\" she makes a point of telling us. Though each wedding set her back by around Rs.40,000. She has not taken a paisa from her sons-in-law. \"They took no dowry, how can I do that?\" She's also managed to educate the girls. \"All of them are matric pass or fail,\" she says. \"Three completed their schooling after he died.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAfter years of leasing them out, \"we will farm our seven acres ourselves this year.\" But Mangalabai knows the risks. \"Look at our village. All families here are in the same boat. Unless something changes in farming, we'll all sink.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This is the situation in Yavatmal and other districts,\" says Mr. Tiwari, \"these widows are farmers who represent the true picture.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n As Mr. Tiwari's letter to President Kalam also says: \"We strongly feel that it all is not well in Vidharbha and therefore, it's not the right time for any cultural or dancing session inauguration ...We would be highly obliged if you could spare a few minutes to meet the unfortunate widows.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<web></web></p> <p align=\"justify\">

In fact, the rice she gets on average for a whole day is far less than what the incarcerated offender gets in a single meal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nJayalakshmamma is not a convict in prison. She's a marginal farmer whose husband H.M. Krishna, 45, killed himself in Huluganahalli village of Mandya district four years ago. This district was among the worst affected by the farm suicides of 2003 in Karnataka. In this State, her BPL (below the poverty line) card entitles her to only four kg of rice (and a kg of wheat) a month. True, those four kg are subsidised by the State. But she cannot afford to buy a lot more than that at prevailing market price. She is also one of over a lakh of women across India who have lost their husbands in suicides arising from the farm crisis these past 14 years.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Four kilograms a month means about 135 grams a day,\" says T. Yashavantha, who is from a farming family of the same district. He is also State vice-president of the Students Federation of India. \"Even an undertrial or convict gets more.\" What's more, they get cooked rice. She gets four kg of grain. Jail diets in the State vary according to whether the prisoner is on a \"rice diet,\" a \"ragi diet\" or a \"chapati diet.\" Jail officials in Bangalore told  <i>The Hindu</i>  \"those on rice diets and doing rigorous imprisonment get 710 grams of cooked rice per meal. Those on non-rice diets get 290 grams of rice. Undertrials and those doing simple imprisonment [who are on rice diets] get 505 grams of rice per meal.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe convict doing rigorous imprisonment does eight hours of labour. Jayalakshmamma does 12 or more. \"But her entitlement is 45 grams per meal if she has three a day,\" points out Mr. Yashavantha. She doesn't have the time, though, to make comparisons. Her daughter now works at breadline wages in a Bangalore garment company. \"At most she can send us Rs.500 in a year,\" she told us at her village. This leaves her son and herself at home. Their joint entitlement on the BPL card would yield 270 grams per day. That is: they would together still get less rice than even a prisoner on \"ragi diet\" gets \u0097  290 grams or more.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThey own around 0.4 acres and had leased two acres before Krishna's suicide. \"On the former we grew vegetables. On the latter, we had sericulture. Vegetable prices have been terrible. Once, we got Rs.1 a kilo for tomatoes. And water costs came to Rs.9,000 (or Rs.70 per hour) over six months.\" Now they have only the 0.4 acres. \"We also sold all our livestock after his death.\" They have been paying off his loans and most of the compensation they received appears to have gone this way. \"My boy Nandipa grazes the goats of others but there's no daily income from it.\" Instead, they will share the offspring of the animals \u0097  if any \u0097  with the owner. \"I myself make Rs.35 a day working this off-season.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I wanted Nandipa to study. But he was in despair. Three years ago, then aged 12, he ran off to Bangalore and worked in a hotel. There he was beaten by the owner. He ran away, took the wrong train and landed up in Mumbai. After a while, he was brought back.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"All widows have problems. But those bereaved by the farm crisis suffer worse,\" says Sunanda Jayaram, president of the women's wing of the Karnataka Rajya Ryuthu Sangha (Puttanaiah group) \"Even after losing her husband she has to maintain his father and mother, her own children and the farm \u0097  with no economic security for herself. And she is saddled with his debts. Her husband took his own life. She will pay the price all her life.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Bidarahosahalli village, Chikktayamma's state exemplifies this. Her husband, Hanumegowda, 38, killed himself in 2003. \"The debts are all we're left with,\" she says, without self-pity. \"What we earn won't pay off even the interest on loans to the money lenders.\" She's struggled to educate her three children \u0097  who might be forced to drop out though all want to study further. \"The girls should study, too. But later, we'll have to raise lots of money for their marriages as well.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOne girl, Sruthi, has done her SSLC exams and another, Bharathi, is in the second year of her pre-university course. Her son Hanumesh is in the 8th standard. Her husband's mother and a couple of other relatives also live in this house. Chikktayamma is the sole breadwinner for at least five people. \"We have only 1.5 acres [on part of which she grows mangoes]. So I also work as a labourer when I can for Rs. 30 a day. I had a BPL card but they [the authorities] took it from me saying `we'll give you a new card.'\" It never came back, says Mr. Yashavantha. \"Instead, they gave her an APL [above the poverty line] one.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nHuge debt\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Huligerepura, Chenamma and her family grapple with a debt of over Rs.2 lakh left by her husband Kadegowda, 60, who took his life four years ago. \"Sugarcane just sank and it crushed him,\" says his son Sidhiraj. \"We have only three acres,\" says Chenamma. \"It's hard to generate a living from that now.\" But she and her sons still try. And the family plans to shift to paddy this year.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Thoreshettahalli, Mr. Yashavantha's father, Thammanna, a farmer for decades, says the farm crisis is biting deep. \"Most cane growers are not recovering the cost of production. Input costs go upwards, incomes downwards. Also, some 40 borewells were drilled in this village last month but only one succeeded. People are giving up. You will find farmland lying unused even during season.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat about self-help groups? Jayalakshmamma has paid an initial amount \"but the group has not yet launched. And I cannot afford the Rs.25 a week. Nor the 24 per cent interest each year.\" Chikktayamma cannot think of making such payments regularly. \"The SHG concept is a good one,\" says KRRS leader K.S. Puttannaiah. \"But in some cases, they've also become moneylenders. Meanwhile, after the initial compensations, the State has no plan for widows and orphans of farm suicides. When have they even thought about it?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Remember, these and all other farm women are breadwinners and have always been so,\" says Ms. Jayaram. \"Yet, they have no land rights and no land security. Even in agricultural labour, they are paid far less than men. Those widowed by the suicides are in constant tension. There are debts hanging on their heads which they did not incur. There are daughters whose marriages are pending. The pressure is unending.\" It is. But all the three women and many more like them in Mandya stand up to it with incredible resilience and still try to run their farms and feed their families with dignity and respect.</p> <p>\r\n</p>

The Agriculture Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Raghuveera Reddy, told  <i>The Hindu</i>  over telephone that, \"following  <i>The Hindu</i>  report, we have directed that she be given a house and a pension. This will take effect from July 1.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n <i>The Hindu</i>  had reported that Lachmamma had never got the house she had been promised after her husband, a farmer, had committed suicide in late 2000. It had also reported that she found it hard to get work at the National Rural Employment Guarantee sites owing to social prejudices against single women, particularly widows. This was based on statements from her and many others too. A new book, <i>Capturing imagination of the stakeholders,</i> also points to a study showing that 200 women in just one village, Borampalli, in Anantapur district had said \"they were not being called for work at all\" because they were single. (Incidentally, our story had said \"The programme itself has benefited lakhs of families in the State.\")\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhile the Minister acted with promptness and alacrity, the district administration is in denial. The Mandal Parishad Development Officer refutes <i>The Hindu</i>'s report. His report says \"there is no truth\" in the statement that single women have struggled to find and retain work at NREG sites. It says Lachmamma was indeed provided work under the NREGP. It then goes on to admit that what she got was all of six days of work for which she \"earned Rs.540 at Rs.90 per day.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe NREGP guarantees Lachmamma 100 days of work, not six. Also, the MPDO admits she was working for Rs.90 a day when \"she did not turn up for work, as she opted to work with a railway contractor in Anantapur town.\" Why did she \"opt\" out of work at Rs.90 a day near her own village to work for a contractor in Anantapur for Rs.60 a day (of which Rs.10 went on transport daily)? In doing so, she is losing Rs.4,000 over 100 days.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe MPDO's report remains silent on the protest by 200 women in Borampalli village against discrimination at NREG sites because they were single. It ties itself into knots by first claiming that \"a house under Indira Aawaz Yojana 2000-01 was sanctioned to the family but they could not come forward to construct the house.\" The next sentence says Lachmamma's name \"is finding place in recently prepared `Indiramma Housing' and old pension eligibility list also.\" Why include her in a `recently prepared' list if she was there from 2000? It happened because the Minister intervened on her behalf. That's why the list was `recently prepared.' Indeed, the `inquiry' itself was rapidly undertaken for fear of the Minister's wrath. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<url></url><web></web></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2007053001681100.htm&amp;date=2007/05/30/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2007/05/30/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://epaper.thehindu.com\">ePaper</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2007053001451000.htm\">A fine JVP initiative</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001441000.htm\">Naxalite  hotbed</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001431000.htm\">Talibanisation of Sikhism</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001671100.htm\">Everything has to be `fun' nowadays</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001711100.htm\">Squabble over immigrants found clinging to tuna nets</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001661100.htm\">Corrections and Clarifications</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001701100.htm\">Life after Downing Street</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001691100.htm\">Faith in oil growth could bring economy crashing</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2007053001681100.htm\">Farm widow to get house from A.P.

That is, nearly two decades after he was Vice Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. This time he was President of India. \"I am happy to see you,\" he said, \"but I do miss the excitement of our campus encounters.\" A reference to the dharnas, protests marches, and other annoyances my friends and I had subjected him to. \"Those were some meetings,\" he said, smiling. \"It could be arranged,\" I said and K.R. Narayanan laughed. \"No, I'm too old for that now. But those were heady days and good memories.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAbout 20 years ago, as VC, he read a few of us the riot act in his room. As always, with great gentleness and good humour. \"It was easier dealing with the Gang of Four,\" the former Ambassador to China told us. \"You fellows are really troublesome.\" But he never lost his shirt and could always see the point of view of those disagreeing with him. He never lost his good humour either. Over a decade later, when I phoned asking him to write a piece for <i>Blitz</i> where I was then working, he recognised my name instantly. He had just been Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Rajiv Gandhi government. \"I'm flattered you've not forgotten me,\" I said. \"You shouldn't be,\" he replied. \"You fellows were such a nuisance. How could I ever forget you?\"</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nI asked him whether that meant he would write the piece for us. \"Do you mean I have a choice?\" he laughed. And wrote it. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTen years after that, I wrote about him. That was when he gave the finest speech ever made by a Head of State in independent India, on the eve of Republic Day. (<i>Frontline</i>, February 5-18, 2000: \"Iron in the soul, decay in the brain\") This was at a time when the glow of neo-liberalism was at its brightest. India was Shining in the media, long before a bunch of hacks coined that silly phrase. While editors and columnists sang hosannas to the brave new world, the resident of Rashtrapati Bhavan showed he had not lost his connection with ordinary people. Many lines from that speech were memorable: \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"It seems, in the social realm, some kind of a counter revolution is taking place in India ...  as a society, we are becoming increasingly insensitive and callous.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The unabashed vulgar indulgence in conspicuous consumption by the noveau riche has left the underclass seething in frustration. One half of our society guzzles aerated beverages, while the other has to make do with palmfuls of muddied water.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"There is sullen resentment among the masses against their condition, erupting often in violent forms... \"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Our giant factories rise from squalor, our satellites shoot up from the midst of the hovels of the poor... \"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"What one finds disconcerting is the absence of even political rhetoric on these social ills.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"... our greatest national drawback [is] the status of our women, and our greatest national shame, the condition of the dalits... \" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven those sections of the Indian press that had always carried the full text of the President's speech avoided that one. Some carried four or five inches in single column. Some skipped it altogether. One wrote an editorial attacking it.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n His speech, it jeered, had \"all the usual lamentations... \" And it advised him to dump compassion. \"There is an Indian market, a market not yet fully free in a democracy. But the state has not fully come to terms with the bazaar. For that we need a statesman with iron in the soul.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFour years after he made that brilliant speech, Indian voters showed they were much closer to his way of thinking. They dumped one of the worst governments this country had ever suffered. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhether it was on the Centre trying to dislodge State governments of a different political hue, or on the ghoulish conduct of the Modi regime in Gujarat, Narayanan told the Union government where it got off. But always working within constitutional limits. This President was no rubber stamp. He was no rubberneck, either, being scrupulous and ethical. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThough he never once mentioned it, just being who and what he was, achieving all he did, trashed the worst stereotypes of caste. This Dalit from Kerala could not find a full time job there despite being a top student, a gold medallist from the University College, Trivandrum. The discrimination he faced in the era of the Travancore royalty was vile and humiliating. Yet, the man who refused to accept his degree certificate in protest would go on to being one of India's finest diplomats and its best President ever. The Merchants of Merit (aka caste hatred) skipped mention of him in their diatribes. For his very existence and stature destroyed their real argument. A casteist denunciation of Dalits as unfit for higher things. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nFull of grace\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNarayanan brought grace and distinction to all that he did. Whether as a diplomat, or as a vice chancellor and intellectual. As a minister, or as President of India. His knowledge was great. So was his commitment to principle. He had opposed the gutting of the Indian Patents Act as an MP and as a Minister. He did not dump those beliefs on getting into high office. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nI did not realise when meeting him at <i>Outlook</i> magazine's 10th anniversary function that it would be our last encounter. He was, of course, much frailer. But he still had the same smile, the same gentle humour, and generosity.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n As years ago when he had responded to my inscription in the copy of my book that I gave him. That read: \"For my old Vice Chancellor: in the admittedly faint hope of persuading him my days on campus were not entirely wasted.\" As he said in reply, he never thought those days were wasted. Just exciting. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

The second paragraph of the story said that of the over one lakh suicides reported, 15 to 16 per cent were by farmers. The reader's doubt was \u0097  is it gross total of one lakh suicides over six years, or by farmers alone?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEnquiries with the Special Correspondent in Delhi, Sandeep Dikshit, who filed the report, made the picture clear. According to figures read out by Union Agriculture, Consumer Affairs and Food and Public Distribution Minister Sharad Pawar in the Rajya Sabha, suicides reported from 1998 to 2003 (the year which figures are available) ranged from 1.04 lakh to 1.10 lakh every year; farmers' suicides in these years numbered 16,015 to 17,471 a year, totalling over one lakh in six years.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor the national population of one billion the proportion of suicides may appear minuscule, but in absolute terms one lakh is no small number. And behind each one of these tragedies is a complex web of factors.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA day or two after this report appeared came the news of a student's death by suicide following the publication of examination results. Another such incident came two days later. Last week there were more, when some examination results were announced.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor journalists, covering suicides raises many questions. In the first place, should an individual suicide be reported at all? If it is done in private, how does it affect others outside the family and how is it newsworthy or in public interest? If it is a phenomenon, as among farmers, weavers, or goldsmiths, it becomes an issue to be discussed (as is being done by P. Sainath incisively in <i>The Hindu</i>, or was done by <i>Frontline </i>some time ago). So also in the case of celebrities.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven when writing about a large number of suicides in one group, where does one draw the line? Will repeated coverage promote \"suicide contagion\" or the \"Werther effect\" as psychologists call it? (Goethe's story of a young dreamer, Werther, who killed himself for lost love led to a spate of suicides by youth.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>The Hindu </i>used to have a policy of not reporting suicides by students after examination results were announced; it was feared that such reporting could be a trigger for more. Such non-reporting is no longer feasible. But the paper's coverage of the tragedies has always been sober and subdued, factual, even when celebrities like TV stars are the victims. In contrast to television coverage of the same events, it does not intrude into the family's privacy.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTotal blackout is not desirable, says Dr. Lakshmi Vijayakumar, founder Trustee of Sneha, the suicide helpline in Chennai. Responsible reporting of this \"multidimensional malaise with social, religious and cultural reasons\" is needed, she says. Her advice is: don't sensationalise, don't describe the method of suicide (such as the chemical used) and don't glorify it.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBehind every suicide is a complex interaction of many factors \u0097  mental, physical, family circumstances, substance abuse, other stresses. There is no simple explanation of the causes, Dr. Lakshmi Vijayakumar notes. In reporting students' suicides, underplay the examination failure aspect, and never feature it \u0097  \"don't make it a seed in vulnerable people,\" she stresses.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nJournalism education has no regular courses on covering suicide. The codes of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC-U.K.) and the Press Council of India are silent on this. A few newspapers mention it in their in-house guidelines. <i>The Guardian</i>, for instance, asks its journalists to exercise restraint on reporting suicide or issues involving suicide, bearing in mind the risk of encouraging others.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDiffering attitudes to this issue were evident some time ago when three London newspapers published pictures of a woman leaping to her death from a building. The others, including <i>The Guardian</i>, did not. A public debate raged over the ethics of such publication and it was taken to the Press Complaints Commission, which did not find substance in the protest. The PCC's decision was widely criticised.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO), through its Suicide Project (SUPRE), and the U.K.-based media ethics charity, Presswise Trust, have comprehensive guidelines for journalists on this subject. The American Society of Suicidology and the U.S. Department of Health's Center for Disease Control have also jointly evolved a set of rules.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome basic conclusions and suggestions emerge: \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are three ways of covering suicide: in graphic detail (as many newspapers in the U.S. still do); not reporting at all; reporting only cases that are genuinely newsworthy (which requires editorial discernment).\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nReporting in \"an appropriate, accurate and potentially helpful manner by enlightened media can prevent tragic loss of lives by suicides\" (Presswise Trust, 2001). It is not coverage per se, but certain types of news coverage that increase suicidal behaviour, WHO points out.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe suggestions include: avoid sensationalism and a description of the method of suicide; do not offer simplistic, knee-jerk explanations such as attempt to cope with personal problems; point out that the cause may be not just a recent event, but complex factors; take account of the impact on the families and show sympathy, understanding, and discretion; describe the consequences of non-fatal attempts as a deterrent; and provide links to a helpline. (When examination results were about to be announced, <i>The Hindu </i>ran two features on the work in Chennai of Sneha which has been active for two decades offering support to the suicide-prone.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is no sustained or adequate media attention to what causes suicide \u0097  mental illness (depression is one main reason and can be treated through medication), physical illness, substance abuse, poverty, unemployment, and relationship failure; the risk factors and warning signals, and so on. These need analysis and explanation from time to time, to highlight the nature and magnitude of the social problem. What is needed from journalists is sensitive, appropriate writing that can promote \"mental health literacy.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i><a

Only to allow for the opening of a new register for the fresh agricultural season starting June 1. The latest list already has a dozen entries in it. As the agrarian crisis deepens, there is a real fear that the new book will match the old.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe 540 suicides listed in the closed register occurred between June 2005 and this May. Of these, over four-fifths took place after November 1 last year. As many as 325 farmers have killed themselves since January. And May was terrible, with nearly 80 farmers taking their own lives during that month. Ten of them doing so on a single day. Some weeks, there have been suicides every eight hours. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe register is the painstaking effort of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti. It has forced the authorities to tighten up their own count. And has also inspired others, including newspapers, to keep their own lists to make sense of what is going on. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhy were the suicides worst this May? Because that's when highly indebted people found themselves unable to raise the credit to buy inputs on the eve of the new season. March, too, was bad, when many either failed to sell their cotton, or were forced to do so at distress rates. The steady rise in the numbers has been on since November, though. That's when it became clear that the `advance bonus' of Rs.500 a quintal \u0097  cancelled by the Maharashtra Government \u0097  would not be restored. The loss borne by farmers because of that alone could be over Rs.1,000 crore. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the fields of Vidharbha have been prepared for cultivation. But there's no money for inputs. Despite much talk of greater credit, crop loans elude many farmers. Whatever the promises, the banks find ways of subverting them. And those at the top turn a blind eye to the process. The banks claim their effort was to cut out `defaulters.' But after seven desperate years, everyone here is a defaulter. The default amounts are mostly below Rs.25,000 (because bank credit was anyway less). But do what they will \u0097  people cannot pay. Where's the money? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBank pressures mean <i>khande palat</i> is spreading even amongst once better-off farmers. Take a farmer seeking a crop loan of Rs.65,000 for seven acres, who has a pending bank loan of Rs.50,000. He clears this by taking a private loan of Rs.50,000 for a single day. He gets the Rs.65,000, but has to pay the lender Rs.52,500. That is, interest of Rs.2,500 for a single day. Which means he is left with Rs.12,500 for seven acres. He also has new debt of Rs.65,000. This is <i>khande palat</i> (or switching the burden from one shoulder to another). You can find many such cases in every village. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo things are quite explosive at the start of the season. Yet, there are several steps the Government can take, if it wants to. Quick measures that would at least slow down the deaths. Allowing for more solid, medium, and long-term solutions to follow. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTo start with, the State could restore the `advance bonus' of Rs.500 a quintal. On 210 lakh quintals (taking the previous year's output as the base), the cutting of the bonus implies a loss of Rs.1,050 crore to farmers \u0097  every year. That's why the suicides shot up after its withdrawal. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAlongside this, the State could ensure \u0097  rather than just speak of \u0097  fresh crop loans for every farmer this new season. The kind of emergency Vidharbha is in, the loans should carry minimal interest. For non-irrigated farmers, they should be interest free (China, as Dr. M.S. Swaminathan has pointed out, has a zero per cent interest rate for farmers.) Without the crop loans, the Andolan Samiti's new register will outdo its predecessor.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe crop loans must be based on the new costs of production per acre and not on outdated prices. Getting this and the \"defaulter\" issue wrong will push many lakhs of people deeper into the grip of moneylenders. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's heresy of course, in this era, to suggest writing off farmers' loans of up to Rs.25,000. (Most of these were smaller sums that have bloated with interest.) You could modulate the measure according to the acreage held by the farmer. And one can endlessly debate the wisdom of such a step. The truth though is simple. Whether you write them off or not, people cannot pay.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere's another vital zone where the State has no excuse. It must procure and provide cheap inputs to prevent fleecing of the farmer. Since they will be starting their season late, input costs will soon reach scarcity rates. The State must \u0097  and can \u0097  provide decent quality seed free. And some other inputs at nominal rates. In any case, it must monitor and regulate the costs of agricultural inputs. The prices extracted from farmers for these have been a quick route to debt. The input dealers are the new, powerful <i>sahucars</i> of the countryside. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTime does not favour the farmer. The State needs to press the entire agriculture and extension machinery into the process at once. And they have to work to a clear mandate. They must distribute free or very cheap inputs \u0097  but not Bt seed, which would prove disastrous. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTo propagate Bt in this unirrigated region, as this State has done, is to court chaos. Many farmers have gone broke putting borrowed money in Bt. Countless others even now take that risk in despair. In Maharashtra, Ministers and film stars promote Bt. There are MLAs, too, with close links to input dealers. This includes some opposition figures. This is a mess Maharashtra needs to get out of.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nIncentives for food crops\r\n</font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt also makes sound sense to give incentives to those who grow food crops. Jowar once held 30 per cent of acreage in the region. Today, that's 5 per cent. This has not only meant loss of a vital food crop, but also a severe scarcity of fodder. An incentive of Rs.1,000 per acre for jowar cultivation would have many benefits. It would give poor farmers sustenance. It would revive a crucial crop of this region. And it would allow real space for animal husbandry with fodder making a comeback.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe State could also ask the Centre to impose a 60 per cent duty on cotton imports. (Equal to that on sugar, Maharashtra's other major crop.) This is needed as western subsidies on cotton have gone over the top. The United States last year gave its 20,000 growers a subsidy of $4 billion. The damage that has done to world cotton prices allows for extra cheap imports that crush cotton growers here. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere's a big need to strengthen the rural employment guarantee programme. There is a huge demand for it where people learn of it. Landless labourers, hit by the fall in farming, are in the worst of shape. You can also see landed farmers with six acres in the queues for work. So great is the pressure. Imagine the plight of the landless. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Government should move fast to curb medical expenses and health debt. This is a rapidly growing component of family debt here. Lots of farmers have mortgaged acres of land to pay their costly private hospital bills. It would make a difference if the State were to set up more public medical centres and bring in more doctors for these. Also, private hospitals must be made to lower their charges.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEducation is one of the badly hit sectors here. It is within the State's power to declare a fees waiver for the children of farm families unable to pay school fees and thus dropping out. Rural children should also not be required to pay for bus tickets when journeying to school. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt higher levels, many children who have got into professional institutions are now unable to now meet the costs. Their parents are bankrupt. Here too, the State could step in to help ease the burden.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBoth Centre and State could get their act together and set up a Price Stabilisation Fund. And link the minimum support price to the wholesale price index. The National Commission for Farmers has already asked for this. Price volatility has been one of the things that has hit farmers hardest. Getting shock absorbers in place to ensure them a decent price would make things a lot better.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThese measures do not add up to a solution to the agrarian crisis. That requires a far more radical approach. And needs us to junk present economic theology. However, many of these are short-term steps that can be taken at once. They would impact on several current aspects of the crisis. Failure to act now could add many hundreds of more entries to the new register of deaths. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

Well, good news for someone, anyway. The collective net worth of 311 Indian billionaires is now Rs.3.64 trillion. This is up 71 per cent from last year, when it was a paltry Rs.2.13 trillion. The tribe has also grown. It now includes 133 new entrants who just months ago were merely millionaires. The daily newspaper that tracks this elite club (<i>Business Standard</i>, November 9, 2005) puts it simply: \"India's billionaires have never had it so good.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome hundreds of millions might never have had it so bad either. So just before we pop the corks on those bottles, have a look at the news from the nation's farm households. There are millions of those, not 311. The average monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) of farm households across India was Rs.503 in 2003. That is just about Rs.75 above the rural poverty line. And it is an average across regions and classes and income groups. So even this dismal figure hides huge inequities.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA big chunk of those households are below the poverty line. Millions of them deeply below it. The Rs.503 figure \u0097  awful in itself \u0097  is derived from an average that clubs States such as Kerala (MPCE Rs.901) and Punjab (Rs.828). And those like Orissa (Rs.342), Jharkhand (Rs.353), Chhattisgarh (Rs.379), and Bihar (Rs.404). Note that in those four regions, even the State-wide average is well below the poverty line. More than a fifth of households in these States and Madhya Pradesh had an MPCE equal to or less than Rs.225.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe numbers are from the National Sample Survey Organisation's \"Situation Assessment Survey of Farmers.\" This survey was done in 2003 as part of the NSSO's 59th round. The official press note tells us that \"such a survey has been conducted for the first time in the history of the NSSO.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven if we take the national figure of Rs.503, the picture is quite bad. For one thing, this clubs huge zamindars and tiny landholders together. So the average, again, misleads. For another, over 55 per cent of this is spending on food. Clothing, footwear, fuel, and light take close to 18 per cent. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHealth spending is double that on education. The average household spends less than Rs.17 a month per capita on education. It spends over Rs.34 a month on health. Also remember, the Rs.503 figure is for people owning some land, large or small. How bad would the picture be for the millions of landless?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven for the landed, if such a great share is grabbed by food, clothing, and health, it leaves little for anything else. That is why (also NSSO data) just six per cent of rural homes have telephones. And that is mainly amongst those with an MPCE of over Rs.950, a lot of which are non-farm households. It is also why we need to postpone the joy over the spread of the Net for a bit. PCs with Net connections almost do not exist in rural India. Just about 0.6 per cent of rural households have a computer.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut back to the farm. The MPCE of farm households is less than that of the non-farm homes by close to 10 per cent. The average for all rural households is Rs.554. Which means the non-farm groups are able to spend more. And this is the case with both food and non-food items. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnother vital fact. These numbers are about consumer expenditure. They do not and cannot tell us how much of this spending was based on incurring debt. Yet we do know from even the flawed data that exists that farm debt is on the rise. And quite steeply. The NSSO seems to underestimate private moneylender debt. Yet it shows that nearly half of all farm households are in debt. In 1991, that figure was 26 per cent. (See <i>BusinessLine</i>, August 30, 2005.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTake Maharashtra. The State ranks third in wealth in the country. But income from agriculture has declined. Bank credit to the farm sector is dismal. Most farmers are forced to turn to private moneylenders. Over 55 per cent of the State's farm households are in debt. That figure would be a lot worse if we looked at, say, Vidharbha. This season has seen a debt-related suicide by a farmer in the region every so many hours. It should also not surprise us that in Andhra Pradesh where farm suicides were at their worst, \"four fifths of surveyed farmers were in debt.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe data from the NSSO survey on farm spending once again points to the link between poverty and family size. The average household size for farmers was 5.5 at the all-India level. But in those with an MPCE equal to or less than Rs.225, the number goes up to 6.9. On the other hand, households with an MPCE of more than Rs.950 were much smaller. Their average size was 4.1. Broadly, the better off the household, the fewer its members. In the NSSO survey, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh logged the highest average household size of 6.1. The poor tend to have larger families. That is their insurance against higher mortality. Particularly against infant mortality. The logic of \"more hands to work\" cannot be wished away.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLimited as the NSSO data are, they still throw up a different picture from the glory days' vision of the private surveys coming out of Delhi. Mostly crawling out of the bottomless data-on-demand pit of the capital's \"think tanks.\" These surveys in turn get the <i>rah rah</i> treatment from a media dying to show how good the \"reform years\" have been. In one case, a daily crowed that \"Bharat-matches-India-in-bang-for-buck.\" This was so over the top that even the gung-ho authors of the survey the daily was quoting felt compelled to write a piece saying \"Don't romanticise the village.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWell, also do not romanticise the growing gap between rich and poor. And do not celebrate gross inequality either.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhen many households have an MPCE of less than Rs.225, you really need to think of how people live. On what it is that they live. What can you spend on if the most you can spend is, on average, Rs.8 a day? And if close to 80 per cent of what you spend is on food, clothing and footwear, what else could you possibly buy?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nContrast that with a year in which 133 people joined the billionaires' club. Taking its membership from 178 to 311. (The collective net worth of this Club was computed by <i>Business Standard</i> on \"the basis of average market prices for promoters' stocks in August 2005.\") On their joint net worth of Rs.3.64 trillion you could run the current rural employment programme for many years. Or, if we take the yearly returns on that net worth to be around eight per cent, then their joint annual income from it would be over Rs.290 billion. Or nearly Rs.800 million each day. On just that, you could every year run a bigger employment programme than anything the Government is bound to now. It could also make a massive difference to the health, housing, and education budgets.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nObscene inequality\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe point though, is that at the other end of the spectrum, the sector that still employs the largest number of Indians is in deep trouble. Obscene levels of inequality stare this society in the face. And there seems to be little concern over this at the top, though some over there know things are bad. Even Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar says in interviews and press briefings that \"the Indian farmer is facing a serious crisis.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt is very hard for those who have been plugging the glorious impact of the reforms to accept this. It undermines their religion. For years now, rural Indians have been viewed as just so many buyers of consumer goods. So we have one interviewer trying repeatedly to get Mr. Pawar to say that things are much better than they are. But the Minister, who took a long time to accept it himself, did not oblige. Mr. Pawar told him the idea that the farmers' living standards have gone down is \"100 per cent correct.\" He also says \u0097  surprise, surprise \u0097  \"the farming community has been ignored in this country. And especially so over the last eight to ten years.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Pawar also tells his interviewer: \"You will be surprised. In the budgetary provision, not more than two per cent money has been allocated for agriculture. [Though that is] where more than 65 per cent of the population works.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat the Government he belongs to tries to apply as a solution that which is the problem is another story. The effects of its approach will make things worse on many fronts in this sector. But maybe we can at least hope for a little less fantasy and a little more focus on the farmer in the media.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

The agrarian crisis in Vidharbha has spun almost out of control. Appeals for swift measures by many have fallen on deaf ears. Calls for remedies by the National Commission on Farmers have been ignored. Farm suicides are on the rise. Sometimes there are two or three in a day. None of this was unforeseen. In fact, it was expected. (See  <i>The Hindu</i> , October 28. \"Vidharbha: Awaiting a deadly harvest.\") \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany inquiries have been held. Some set up by a government that hopes at least one will yield a friendly finding. That has not happened. The latest such study by the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research further damages the Deshmukh outfit. So did one by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (done at the behest of the Bombay High Court) in March this year. Both point to big, policy-driven failures.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nVidharbha's mainly cotton farmers have been hit by rising input costs and the crash of output prices. They have also been ruined by the collapse of rural credit. The banks will simply not help them. So they turn to moneylenders. While 58 per cent of all farm households in the State are in debt, it's a lot worse in Vidharbha. Here, close to 90 per cent of short-term credit needs are met by private loan sharks. Meanwhile, farmers have also been crushed by fake seed dealers. Mindless de-regulation has crippled the sector. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe farm suicides are the tip of the huge crisis raging here, not  its whole. They are, though, its most powerful symbol. The Maharashtra Government has given out three divergent figures on the deaths. It told the National Human Rights Commission that 140 farmers in the whole State had taken their  lives. This was during 2001-04. These deaths, it said, were debt-driven. (<i>Indian Express</i>, July 7, 2005.) A little later, it shifted ground. In a note this year, it hiked the number to 524  for the same period. Yet, this October, it told the National Commission on Farmers (NCF) something startling. Well over 300 suicides had occurred in Yavatmal alone between 2001 and September this year. That is, in just one of Vidharbha's 11 districts. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe same data show that farm suicides in Yavatmal have doubled almost every year in that period. There's more. Just 11 of the 307 families who lost a loved one this way got any compensation at all. Since the day the NCF team arrived in Nagpur on October 18, there have been 60 more suicides in Vidharbha. As many as 32 of them in Yavatmal alone. A worried NCF made vital recommendations for relief. These have mostly been ignored by the State. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe crisis captures the decay of the political class in Vidharbha. No MP or MLA tried to even meet the NCF team led by Dr. M.S. Swaminathan. This, although the team had in tow the young Rana Patil, Maharashtra's Minister of State for Agriculture. It gets worse. The MLAs from the districts most affected are mainly from the Shiv Sena and the BJP.  Why help your rivals? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the advance bonus normally paid to cotton farmers has been scrapped. This amount of roughly Rs.500 used to be added on to the minimum support price for cotton declared by the Centre. The State admits it costs around Rs.2200 to produce a quintal of cotton. Yet the scrapping of the advance bonus means farmers will get Rs.1700 a quintal. A price last seen in 1994. The Maharashtra Cotton Federation is a mess. This year, the Federation had its first elections in living memory. That too, an indirect one. Since 1972, this body set up for <i>kisans</i>, has never had a ballot where farmers could vote directly. Those who grow cotton have little say in its running. And none at all in the shaping of larger policy. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHuge delays in paying farmers their dues (on the cotton it had procured) was just one failure. The Federation made things worse by paying them in instalments. Making their need for quick cash much sharper. It also increased their burden by cutting bank dues from their earnings. So more and more farmers turned away from the body towards moneylenders.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNew sahucars\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAbout the only action the Government has taken after the NCF's visit is a crackdown on moneylenders. Very good. But here's the problem. One, the new <i>sahucars</i>, the powerful input dealers, are barely touched. They are not seen in the village, anyway. The small-time village lender is. And he is taking the heat. Ending harassment is right and deserves support. But it comes at a time when the formal credit system has packed up. Thus the banks won't give the farmer money. And the little lender is afraid to. So even weddings and funerals are held up. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the State Government has helped boost private traders. Those who exploit this mess to lift the farmer's produce at rock bottom prices. Their parallel markets can now function openly. Also, the State has never pushed the Centre to stop the dumping of highly subsidised cotton from the rich nations. Giant subsidies by the United States to its producers have killed the price of cotton. The duty on cotton imports is just 10 per cent. On sugar \u0097  affecting western Maharashtra \u0097  it is 60 per cent. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, few other governments have brought in so many anti-poor measures. The Prime Minister's distaste for the two-child norm means nothing to his party in Maharashtra. Here, the State passed an Act that will make irrigation water charges one and a half times costlier for those farmers having more than two children. It has already played havoc with the norm in the panchayats. This is punishing people for being poor. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPoorer families tend to be larger than better off ones. That is an insurance against higher child mortality. (See  <i>The Hindu</i> , Nov. 18) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn barring them from contesting local body polls, the Government stifles their voices.  Its new bright idea is to punish those who have no toilets in their homes. It has a Bill coming that would bar members of such households from fighting local body elections. A move that is anti-democracy in a profound sense. But that means little to a regime which delights in demolishing the homes of the poor. Meanwhile, Mr. Deshmukh's Ministers call for selling off the last green spaces in Mumbai to private, mostly corporate hands. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>Vidharbha is a happy hunting ground for money-grubbers. Ministers, officials and film stars have done paid-for propaganda for Bt cotton. The hard sell has worked, too. Many small farmers for whom this risk will prove fatal have embraced it. One last desperate throw of the dice. Some film stars earned undisclosed lakhs for their skills. But it will be some time before these `brand ambassadors,' dare visit the region again. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>The resources and energies of this State, in agriculture at least, flow mostly towards western Maharashtra. That province too, has its share of small farmers in distress. But the loot is conducted in their name. The super rich who rule the region have seldom lacked for credit. Or much else. The last year alone has seen thousands of crores of rupees going in credit and subsidies to  cooperatives. Bodies that have ripped off massive sums from the provident funds of their members and employees. To sick sugar mills run by healthy barons who will never repay their loans. To units that owe hundreds of crores in power bills that they have no intention of paying. To rich horticulturists, some of whom are hobby farmers based in the city. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>Contrast this with Vidharbha's farmers taking their lives for lack of a minor crop loan. Or with small farmers in western Maharashtra who find their funds siphoned off by the rich bosses of their cooperatives. Political heavies who will not be brought to book. The big new idea from the region? Wine to be freely sold in shops and stores. Never mind the public interest issues involved. This would boost an elite already locked into State largesse. It would do little for Vidharbha where a litre of milk sells for a lot less than a litre of bottled water. The just announced waiver of Rs.100 crore of interest on loans bypasses poor cotton farmers. It does, though, help rich horticulturists in irrigated Western Maharashtra. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>One good development though, is that political protests have begun in the region. The sense of a great letdown by the Shetkari Sanghatana had kept people away from such action for years. This week saw dharnas and sit-ins. And they've drawn not just farmers but playwrights and professors, teachers and journalists. And others as well. People moved by their conscience and the misery they are witness to. And with the knowledge that this is man-made. Vidharbha might yet see the power of moral reasoning beat back the mad rush for profits from human misery. <p>\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p><p>                                                         \r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p><p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005120205021000.htm&amp;date=2005/12/02/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2005/12/02/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p><center>\r\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" color=\"d0f0ff\"><script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\r\ngoogle_alternate_ad_url=\"http://www.thehindu.com/ktredirrec.html\";\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-6238405171313215\";\r\ngoogle_ad_width = 300;\r\ngoogle_ad_height = 250;\r\ngoogle_ad_format = \"300x250_as\";\r\ngoogle_ad_type = \"text_image\";\r\ngoogle_ad_channel =\"\";\r\n//--></script><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\">\r\n</script><hr noshade size=\"1\" color=\"d0f0ff\"></center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p><p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/classads/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/jobs/index.htm\">Employment</a> | \r\n<a href=\"16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p></el1></p></el1></p></el1></p></el1></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>The resources and energies of this State, in agriculture at least, flow mostly towards western Maharashtra.

Or with small farmers in western Maharashtra who find their funds siphoned off by the rich bosses of their cooperatives. Political heavies who will not be brought to book. The big new idea from the region? Wine to be freely sold in shops and stores. Never mind the public interest issues involved. This would boost an elite already locked into State largesse. It would do little for Vidharbha where a litre of milk sells for a lot less than a litre of bottled water. The just announced waiver of Rs.100 crore of interest on loans bypasses poor cotton farmers. It does, though, help rich horticulturists in irrigated Western Maharashtra. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>One good development though, is that political protests have begun in the region.

This could not come at a worse time for the embattled farmers of Vidharbha. The amount of cotton being picked up by State agencies is at a dismal low.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Private traders are buying a lot more \u0097  but often at below the minimum support price (MSP). Total output in the State is down by at least 50 lakh quintals. So there is no relief for the cotton grower.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLast year, there were 411 official centres to procure cotton. This year a mere 141. \"But that's because open market prices are better,\" insists N.P. Hirani. He is chairman of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Cotton Growers' Marketing Federation. But on the ground, his claim is challenged by farmers in Vidharbha. Most say the traders' prices are even lower than the MSP. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPrivate centres now number 210. \"It is a policy move to reduce procurement,\" says Vijay Jawandia. \"The government is pushing farmers towards private traders.\" The region's foremost farm activist, he warns that \"this will mean more losses on the price front. Farmers have already lost Rs.1,000 crore as a result of the `advance bonus' scheme being shut down. This is forced privatisation of the trade.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLate last year, the State withdrew the \"advance bonus\" of Rs.500 a quintal. Which brought down what the farmer received to the MSP of Rs.1,700 a quintal. On a likely output of 200 lakh quintals, that is the loss of Rs.1,000 crore Mr. Jawandia speaks of.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat is not all they will lose, though. Costs were up 25 per cent last year because of rising input prices. Many more people went in for the costly Bt cotton. Further, many farmers lost the first sowing due to bad weather and had to sow again. The losses from these problems, says an official source, are not less than Rs.500 crore and could be closer to Rs.1,000 crore.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nSteep fall in procurement\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe fall in procurement is even more drastic than the fall in the number of Government centres. The Cotton Federation's official chart shows that by February 11 this year, it had procured just 4.83 lakh quintals. A gigantic fall from the 178 lakh quintals picked up by the same date last year. In cash terms the fall is massive. The value of what was acquired from the farmers last year on this date was Rs.3,970 crore. This year, it is a mere Rs.54.73 crore.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHas that been offset by the rise in private procurement? \"Not one bit,\" says Mr. Jawandia. And his view is echoed by farmers at the markets in Yavatmal. At the official centre in Ghattanji, there were over 300 bullock carts with cotton piled up. \"The private traders start off in the morning by offering Rs.2,000 a quintal,\" say the farmers crowding around us. \"But in a few hours the price is down to Rs.1,600.\" They see the initial high offer as a ploy to draw the crowds to the private centre.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The farmer is getting a price neither from the Federation, nor from the traders,\" says S.N. Deshmukh. He is a former general manager (sales and procurement) of the Federation. \"But you will find a rush to the Federation very soon. So far the grower has held out for a better price. Now he will take it to them as he has few other options.\" Some 40 per cent of the output is thought to still be with the farmers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut private traders have bought far more cotton than the official body. \"They have purchased close to 100 lakh quintals,\" says a Federation official. At an average private price of Rs.1,600, \"farmers will lose Rs.600 crore at the least,\" says Mr. Jawandia.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"If the Federation price had been the same as last year,\" he points out, \"not a single trader would have ventured into buying cotton.\" This seems borne out by last year's numbers. Then, the Federation alone mopped up more than four-fifths of the total production.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Hirani of the Federation estimates that production in the State is down. \"It could be less by almost 50 lakh quintals this year,\" he told  <i>The Hindu</i> . \"Last year it was over 250 lakh quintals.\" The value of that lost output, estimates Mr. Jawandia, \"is around Rs.850 crore.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSources in the Agriculture Commissioner's office in Pune dispute this. They say last year's figure was misleading. \"A lot of that 250 lakh quintals came from neighbouring States,\" they assert.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"This year that has not happened. We believe yield and productivity have gone up. It is 213 kg per hectare as against 176 kg last year.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat claim is scoffed at in Nagpur. \"Output this year will in truth not exceed 160 lakh quintals,\" says one official source. \"Bt cotton was a disaster. Also, the crop was hit by diseases.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs Bt bombed for many, they used pesticides for that too. In a country where cotton is anyway the highest user of pesticides, this further upped the farmer's costs.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Don't ignore the problem of the small trader, either,\" says Mr. Deshmukh. \"Early on, a few did pick up cotton at prices that might hurt them. And there seems to have been a fall in `micronaire value' in this crop. That is a technical measure that makes for better spinning. Small traders could be in troubled waters when they sell.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nImports of cotton have further depressed prices over the years. India's cotton imports between 1997-98 and 2004-05 stood at over 115 lakh bales. That is over three times what was imported in the preceding 25 years. In the same 1997-98 to 2004-05 period, exports did not cross 30 lakh bales. In some years, they fell in both number of bales and value earned.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWorld cotton prices tumbled in the 1990s as the United States pumped billions of dollars of subsidies each year to its 25,000 cotton producers. \"And we,\" says Mr. Jawandia, \"have left our millions of cotton farmers to the mercy of traders and the subsidised global market. Now anyone can import or export it. The import duty on cotton is ten per cent. And if you're the textile lobby you don't pay even that. Anyone can buy, sell or trade in it. Private trade is up, boosted by a withdrawing state. Our cotton economy is the closest thing to a `free market' \u0097  and see the results.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

There have been 200 since June 2. But the last 100 have occurred in less than two months. As many as 64 farmers have taken their own lives in December alone thus far. The total for the year is over 300. This month, the Maharashtra Government admitted to over 1,000 farmer's suicides in the State since 2001. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The numbers are mounting,\" says Kishore Tiwari of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti. \"Efforts to stop them are failing.\" The `Register of Deaths' the Andolan maintains in Yavatmal district is flowing over. Even this register is based mainly on newspaper reports. Which means deaths that have gone unreported do not make it to the tally. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Note that the rise in suicides has followed the fall in cotton price,\" points out Vijay Jawandia, Vidharbha's leading farm activist. \"This is no surprise. The government's so-called `relief package' of Rs. 1,045 crore for the farmer has not had the slightest impact on the trend.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nMinister's suicide bid\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt is three weeks since the Maharashtra Government announced its package in the Assembly session at Nagpur. That came after the former Minister, Gulabrao Gawande's attempted suicide on the floor of the House in a bid to highlight the farm crisis. His action shocked the State and he was tossed out of the Assembly for the rest of the session. But the session was wound up weeks earlier than it should have been. So this didn't mean much. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHowever, little is now heard of the \"Rs. 1,045 crore package.\" That, says Mr. Jawandia, is because \"there is no package. It's mostly farmers' money. Plus, money from existing schemes. They have in fact taken away much more from the farmer than they have given to him.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe advance bonus of Rs.550 normally paid to cotton growers has been scrapped this year. This amount used to be added on to the minimum support price set by the Centre. Without it, the cotton price per quintal falls from Rs.2250 to Rs.1700 roughly \u0097  that is, to the level of the Centre's minimum support price (MSP). \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Scrapping the advance bonus means a loss of Rs.1,100 crore to the farmer,\" points out Mr. Jawandia. \"And that isn't the only problem.\" Over a third of the package is simply the farmer's own money. That is, some Rs.370 crore have come from what is known as the `capital formation fund' of the Cotton Federation. That body normally deducts three per cent of the MSP given to farmers for that fund. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis money, anyway their own, is to now be returned to the farmers. Yet, that now makes things harder for both. Without that sum in its kitty, it becomes far tougher for the Federation to raise loans from the banks. That in turn affects the farmers from whom it will have to purchase less. Cotton growers are thus pushed into selling to private traders at prices as low as Rs.1500 a quintal. This now fuels farmer anger with a government that came to power promising them Rs.2700 a quintal. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarm activists also protest what they see as a lot of `fake accounting.' An official from the agriculture department of one of the troubled districts told  <i>The Hindu</i> : \"A lot of the `package' money is from other schemes already in place. There's too much juggling. Soil conservation, watershed, other allied activities, all are now mixed up in this package.\" The much-touted waiver of interest on loans comes to just Rs.61 crore. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPerhaps the one new element of the package is the State's decision to arrange for the marriages of farmers' daughters in the six districts seeing the most suicides. It has set aside Rs.1 crore per district for this purpose. \"This amounts to telling the farmer we'll look after you when you're dead,\" says Kishore Tiwari. \"You go ahead with your suicide. We'll get your daughter married.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome communities have proved more innovative than the government. Like in Dorli village in Wardha district. Farmers here simply put up signs announcing their whole village was for sale. As gram panchayat members told journalists: \"We await a customer. Let's sell the village, pay our dues and move out. That's better than suicide.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor Dorli, that's worked a bit. The Member of Parliament for the region, Datta Meghe, quickly announced Rs.10 lakh for schemes in the village from his MPLADS fund. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nElsewhere, despair overrides such drama. Debt-driven farm suicides are now on in rich Western Maharashtra, too. Even wealthy Baramati has not escaped them.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Government's response has been to crack down on private moneylenders. Over 500 <i>sahucars</i> have been booked in Vidharbha since the drive against them began a month ago.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n In itself a welcome action, it has misfired for two reasons. The banks still do not give loans to farmers. And secondly, the new <i>sahucars</i>, that is, the input dealers and others, are left untouched. With the small village <i>sahucars</i> on the run, there is now no source of credit at all for many. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"None of the real issues have been touched,\" says Mr. Jawandia. \"Not the burning problem of price. Not credit. Not the headache of mounting imports. Nor the damage that BT cotton is doing, pushing so many farmers over the edge. The package is not even about shifting money from one pocket to another. It's about stealing from both pockets. Now, with the changes in the marketing rules, private traders rule the roost. The middlemen have become the top men.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the deaths continue. Maharashtra began by telling the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) that there had been 140 suicides Statewide since 2001. It ends this year conceding a figure of 1,041. That is, the fourth figure the same State has put out within months.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n For Vidharbha, it is decidedly not a happy new year.

He clocked in as Entry No. 301 in the \"Register of deaths\" kept by the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti. That is, he was the 301st farmer in the region to take his own life since June 2 last year. In the tally of a leading Marathi newspaper, <i>Sakaal</i>, he would figure as No. 278. In the most chilling list of all, he may not merit a number as yet. That is the post-mortems register of the medical centre closest to his village in Yavatmal district.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSuroshe's death in Nageshwadi was a bit unusual. The small farmer hanged himself. Most farmers killing themselves have swallowed pesticide. So much so that the verdict of death by \"poisoning\" has become synonymous with farm suicides. And those numbers have been rising in Vidharbha. Not least in Yavatmal. Since September 2005, post-mortem centres in Maharashtra are open 24 hours by government order. Which means that smaller local centres can now take some of the load off the main district hospitals.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe post-mortem centre at the sub-district hospital in Panderkauda \u0097  the heart of the cotton country \u0097  is a busy one. Here, poison deaths between October and early February were nearly three times the number seen in the same period two years ago. Also, they make up fully 75 per cent of all post-mortems this season. That is, 36 of the 48 post-mortems done so far. Further, the centre here is just one of its kind. There are 16 in the district of Yavatmal. And dozens more across Vidharbha.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarm suicides have been on in disturbing numbers for some years now in the region. But there has been an ugly spurt since last October. By the end of that month, the price for cotton that farmers were getting sank by Rs.500 a quintal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Which means Maharashtra's cotton growers lost some Rs.850 crore on that count alone. The fall came with the Government's decision to withdraw the \"advance bonus\" of Rs.500 a quintal. By November, it was clear this would not be restored.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Panderkauda, poison cases during October-February stood at almost double the number of all post-mortems done in the same period two years ago. The total number of post-mortems has also risen. From 206 in 2003-04, to 223 the next year. With a month and a half still left in the current year, it is past the 210 mark. And this is the worst period. \"Of course almost all are small farmers,\" says a doctor in this town of the deaths. \"There may be some poison cases of a different nature. But then there are also farmers who have hanged or drowned themselves.\" He also points out that these are the figures of just one centre in a single district. There are scores of post-mortem centres across Vidharbha.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the total number of suicides is mounting. \"It was clear this would happen once they cut the advance bonus,\" says Kishore Tiwari of the Jan Andolan Samiti. It is in the Samiti's register that  Suroshe now resides as No. 301. There have been six more after him. Which brings the tally to 307. This figure only covers deaths reported in the newspapers. So it is not exhaustive. The Government's own count is 315 since April 1, 2005.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n The official figure begins on that date as it sticks to the financial year. The Andolan number starts from June 2 by when the farming season was in full swing. <i>Sakaal</i> goes by the count of its own reporters. The Andolan also keeps logs for two or three years past. The Government has changed its figure on the suicides four times in six months. And always upwards. From 140 to 1,041 State-wide. ( <i>The Hindu</i> , December 29, 2005.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Government admits to 309 farm suicides in Yavatmal alone from 2001 to September last year. That count would now stand at around 400 for the district. Much less than 10 per cent of the families hit by the suicides have got any compensation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCollapse of cotton economy\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe numbers since October are appalling. That month saw 20 farmers take their lives in the region. There were 52 in November, 72 in December, and 68 in January. February is still on. With few signs of a slowdown. The cotton economy has collapsed and most fear there is worse to follow. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile a new study adds fresh data to the subject. A team from the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research, Mumbai, looked at agrarian distress in Yavatmal, Washim, and Wardha districts. It also studied the larger trends of suicides in Maharashtra. One devastating finding is on the spiral in the State's SMR or suicide mortality rate. (That is: suicides per 100,000 population.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The SMR for male farmers in Maharashtra trebled from 17 in 1995 to 53 in 2004.\" In contrast, says the report, for all males in the State, it stabilised at a level of 20 or 21 after 2001. For women it even fell after 1999. Clearly, farmers have taken a huge hit. So much so that it pushes up the State's overall SMR level. \"In 2001, age-adjusted SMR for males was 20.6 in Maharashtra compared to India's 14.0.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe SMR for male farmers across Maharashtra is 53. That is nearly four times the national average for all males. In affected districts like Amravati, the figure for male farmers was 140 in 2004. That is, ten times the national average for all males. And seven times the State's average for males. Vidharbha's farmers are in deep trouble. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn over two-thirds of the 111 farm suicides the study looked at, those taking their lives were less than 50 years old. They were not novices. Close to 60 per cent had been farmers for over ten years. Two in five had seen matric-level schooling. And four of every five suicides were deaths by poisoning. That is, by drinking pesticide.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the suicides have spread to the region's paddy belt. Not as yet in huge numbers. But enough to cause alarm. There have been 24 in the paddy belt of Gondhia, Bhandara, and east Chandrapur since June 2 last year. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNot a paisa of the Government's Rs.1,075 crore \"relief package\" has been disbursed so far. \"How do those in Mumbai care,\" asks Kishore Tiwari. \"The suicides have crossed 300. But the SENSEX has crossed 10,000.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p>

This as one part of their \"atma vishwas jagruti abhiyan\" campaign. That is, an awareness and confidence building programme in the district. The aim is to boost the morale of a farming community now rocked by large numbers of suicides. \"There have been 13 such programmes,\" Sub-Divisional Officer Dilip Swami told us in Pusad. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The region has a long tradition of spiritual movements linked to social reform,\" says a top official. \"So in itself, this might even be a good thing. But the question is if government should organise such events. Whether its officers should preside over them. And if this makes sense when the State does nothing about those problems driving farmers to suicide. In such a situation, the SDO or Tehsildar singing on the stage may not be the best solution.\" There have been 307 farmers suicides in the Vidharbha region since June 2. Over 200 of these since November 1. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOverall, the awareness programme aims to make the farmers in this depressed region `positive.' And to \"educate them in due course on government schemes they can gain from.\" And if it seems whacky to many, its authors' motives are honourable. But the list of official attempts to come to grips with the huge crisis gets more bizarre.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTwo officials of the Social Forestry Department, for instance, advised farmers to plant their crops and trees anew. Not on soil and climatic notions. But according to favourable zodiac signs. This provoked an enraged principal of an agriculture college to blast them in the press. This, M.M. Borkar told the daily <i>Lokmat</i>, \"was an example of intellectual bankruptcy and an attempt to befool people.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnother official tack is simple falsification. As when the family of Hiraman Patil was denied compensation after his suicide in 2004. \"He took his life because of tension over his debts,\" says his son Santosh in Virahat village of Akhola. \"But they [the Government] argued that he did not die for this reason. They insisted he had killed himself because he was depressed over my mother's death.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere was a glitch in that argument. Hiraman's wife had died 15 years ago. That came out with an intervention in a PIL by <i>Deshonnati</i> Editor Prakash Pohare. An annoyed Bombay High Court slammed the Government. It ordered that Patil's family be paid Rs.1 lakh within two weeks from January 19. \"I have received the first Rs.30,000,\" Santosh confirmed when we met him at his home. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThen came Home Minister R.R. Patil's crackdown on moneylenders. This focussed entirely on the small village lender. It ignored the new class of <i>Sahucars</i> \u0097  the input dealers. These dealers now use credit and input prices to exploit the farmer. Since the banks have shut out the farmer, the dealer has a free hand. He charges extra for his inputs. The farmer might pay Rs.125 for something that costs Rs.100. Further, the dealer tags on an interest rate of Rs.2 or Rs.3 per Rs.100 each month on the total cost. (He justifies this by saying he is giving the farmer three months time to pay the bills.) And often, he has first call on the farmer's harvest. Mostly at a very low price that hurts the latter. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince big input dealers are well off persons rarely seen in the village, they dragged out and roughed up. The result was the complete loss of credit at the village level. Weddings and funerals were held up as no one would lend the small amounts these needed. It has also had the effect of making people lie about private debt. In suicide-hit households surveyed by  <i>The Hindu</i>  before Mr. Patil's crackdown, people spoke to us at length about their debt to moneylenders. After the crackdown, they've clammed up about private debt. Now many speak only of what they owe to the banks. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Home Minister went further during a speech in Kolhapur in January. There he said that <i>kisans</i> in remote hamlets should have guns for self-defence. Since this was not Naxal terrain, he was talking about their protecting themselves against moneylenders. The Arms for Farms speech drew much fire. \"If all is well on the law and order front,\" said <i>Lokmat</i>, \"then why should farmers raise arms? And where will they get the money for the guns?\" The paper went on to say that farmers were ending their lives due to huge debts. And because they were unable to meet the basic needs of their families. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOther critics were less polite. There were those who said the armed farmer could use his gun \"to shoot both <i>sarkar</i> and <i>sahucar</i>.\" And those who asked: \"Who do they think could afford the ammunition? They can't afford food.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere was also the Government's much touted `relief package' of Rs.1,075 crore for those crushed by Vidharbha's ongoing agrarian crisis. The Government announced the fund in December. More than two months later, not a paisa of it has been disbursed. The problem is, as every analyst here is quick to point out, \"there was never really any package.\" About Rs.700 crore of that `package' is farmer money, anyway. ( <i>The Hindu</i> , Dec. 29, 2005.) The Cotton Federation normally deducts three per cent of the minimum support price (MSP) given to farmers for its `capital formation fund.' Farmers will now get back that money. This will not help and will hamstring the Federation's ability to negotiate loans with banks. In any case, nothing has happened. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA more well meaning effort was the despatch in 2004 of teams to `counsel' the distressed farmers. Not with <i>bhajan-kirtans</i> but with advice from psychologists, doctors and revenue officials. In one village, after a long discussion with such a team, a farmer asked them: \"You've given us great advice on so many things. On combating stress, curbing our drinking and so on. And you've asked us so many probing questions, too. Now ask us one more. Ask us why farmers, who produce the nation's food, are themselves starving.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006021805511100.htm&amp;date=2006/02/18/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2006/02/18/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2006021803381000.htm\">Reading the  growth signals</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006021803371000.htm\">India evens  the score</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006021803361000.htm\">The nuclear issue and Iran's domestic debate</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006021805521100.htm\">\"India supports diplomatic efforts  for amicable solution\"</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006021805511100.htm\">Creative solutions, sarkari style</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006021805531100.htm\">\"They are Buddhas\"</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006021805501100.htm\">Not dead enough?</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2006021803351000.htm\">Muslims &amp;

Madhiletti, 29, went by the advice of well-meaning neighbours. \"There is an official helpline for farmers in distress,\" they told him. \"So even if you are deep in debt, do nothing rash. Contact the helpline and they will do something.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo he did. Mr. Madhiletti's brush with the helpline \u0097  which saw a revenue inspector harass him for a bribe \u0097  convinced him that suicide was the only way out. The indebted farmer tried killing himself right at the Collectorate in Mahbubnagar. He failed and wound up paying thousands of rupees in hospital costs. And the man who had gone to the helpline for aid, languished in jail on the charge of attempted suicide until his hard-up village took out a collection and raised bail for him. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe day he decided to kill himself, Mr. Madhiletti walked into the Red Cross Centre at Mahbubnagar town \u0097  to donate blood. \"I thought if I am going to end my life, let someone benefit from it,\" he told us at his home in Rajouli village. \"The Red Cross people said `we can't give you money for your blood.' That made me angry since I had not asked for any. I told them I was not doing it for payment. So they took my offer.\" He shows us the certificate dated August 11, 2005, confirming his blood donation. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"All I wanted from the Government was help with a bank loan. My family has 12 acres, after all, and surely we should get a loan against that land? But we could not.\" He is the eldest son in a family of 12.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I tried for months to meet the officials and tell them of my problems,\" says Mr. Madhiletti. Rising costs and crop failure in successive seasons had left him Rs.3 lakh in debt. This Mahbubnagar farmer grows sunflower, cotton, and maize. He also supplies seed to a private corporation. \"The company gives us some advance money, towards input costs, through a middleman,\" says a neighbour. \"Our risks are high, but the losses are never shared by the company or the middlemen.\" For Mr. Madhiletti, those losses just got too much. He had also spent close to Rs.3 lakh on two borewells and a pipeline.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I approached the Chief Minister with a petition,\" he says. \"He said he was handing over my plea to the District Collector and I should follow up there. I did, but it seemed impossible to meet anybody.\" Meanwhile, his debts were mounting and so was pressure from the middlemen. At one point, he says, he even saw the Collector. But \"he did not speak. And I had no chance to explain.\" Nor was accessing other officers any easier.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAfter some weeks of this, when he was really depressed, the helpline idea came up. That was set up in 2004 by the newly elected Congress Government. Andhra Pradesh had witnessed thousands of distress suicides by indebted farmers since 1998. The idea was to counsel, advise, and assist farmers, and to stop them from taking the extreme step. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Finally I got through to the MRO [Mandal Revenue Office],\" says Mr. Madhiletti. \"I was told a Revenue Inspector would enquire into my case. What is there to enquire, I asked. I am just seeking a bank loan and you can see my documents of land ownership right here.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Next, the revenue inspector called me and asked me for a bribe. He said: `if you want a report in your favour without any fuss, pay me Rs.2,000.' As simple as that.\" Mr. Madhiletti did not pay the bribe. \"While I was out of town for a day, the RI went ahead and made the visit.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Firstly,\" says Mr. Madhiletti, \"my family did not want that sort of public exposure of our troubles.\" More importantly, \"that visit of the officer scared off all potential creditors. Those who might have loaned me something now would not.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe bribe demand and all that followed it drove the farmer over the edge. \"I tried meeting the Collector again, but failed. I also went to the Red Cross and gave blood.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Madhiletti returned to the Collectorate and waited hours but was still unable to meet anyone. That was when he consumed the pesticide he had bought the same day. After an attender at the office found him lying in agony, he was bundled into a car and rushed to the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) in Hyderabad some 100 km away. All this was done in a matter of hours by officials who had had no time to meet him in months. \"One officer went all the way to Hyderabad with him,\" says a neighbour.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"He spent nearly two weeks at NIMS,\" says his father Easwaranna. \"The costs came to over Rs.10,000.\" Mr. Madhiletti came home on August 23. The distraught farmer had not yet recovered from his ordeal when the police showed up at his door and booked him for attempted suicide. \"I spent one night at the station and was produced the next morning in court,\" he says. He then went to jail for about 15 days. He might have stayed in longer since he had no money for bail. \"But we got together a collection and helped him out,\" say his neighbours \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo Mr. Madhiletti emerged from jail thanks to the few thousand rupees put up by his friends. He's been summoned to court twice since then. \"But each time, the case was adjourned without a hearing. The last date was January 7 this year.\" He again failed to meet the Collector. But after news of the event spread, officials ensured he got a bank loan of Rs.20,000 at eight per cent interest. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe villagers, though, have drawn a bleak lesson from this saga of a little farmer and the mighty apparatus of state. \"From their point of view,\" says a local journalist, \"none of this would have happened if he had paid that bribe of Rs.2,000. He would have had no problem.\" But Mr. Madhiletti has little time for reflection. He has to fulfil his contract with an unsparing seed company. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<web></web></p> <p align=\"justify\">

Almost every child in Wayanad knows the two words that drive it: <i>kharshika prathisandhi</i>. Or agrarian crisis. They mean a lot in a district that has lost over Rs. 10,000 crore of income in the past five years. Close to Rs. 6,000 crore of that in losses suffered on coffee and pepper alone. Huge drops in prices have also hit cardamom, tea, ginger, and vanilla. This is also a district that has seen hundreds of farm suicides in that period.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNormally, polls in this region have seldom been of the photo-finish kind the State is famous for. The United Democratic Front (UDF) has long been dominant. Overwhelmingly so. The clout of the Church in this devout, conservative belt also helped keep Wayanad on a strongly anti-Left track for decades. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has rarely captured even local bodies in this tiny district. In Sulthan Bathery, it could not wrest control of the panchayat for 35 years. Wayanad as a whole has been staunch Congress territory.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis time, it is different. The <i>kharshika prathisandhi</i> has transformed the arena. Lively battles that could change the face of this region are on in all three seats here. The crisis has hit all, across party, community, religious and caste lines. \"Everybody is affected. No one is exempt,\" says Krishna Prasad, Left Democratic Front candidate for the Sulthan Bathery seat. Mr. Prasad also heads a 14-organisation front that has been trying to fight the crisis. This front combines farm unions, NGOs, and other bodies of diverse political forces. The dynamic Mr. Prasad has worked tirelessly on the agrarian issue and has won support across political lines.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFacing him is the UDF's N.D. Appachan, former Congress MLA from here. He is now with the DIC (K). Mr. Appachan is equally clear that \"the problems of agriculture are the main thing here.\" But he resigned 10 months before his term ended in support of his mentor and former Chief Minister K. Karunakaran when the latter split the Congress party. This now goes against him. In Irulam, staunch Congress supporters such as cinema theatre owner Raman Kutty are angry with him. \"Governments only work in the last ten months of their term,\" grumbles Mr. Kutty. \"That's when they release money for projects, as the polls draw near. And in those ten months we had no MLA because this man resigned.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat he broke away from their party has also upset Congress workers. Nor is he helped by the fact that a section of the DIC(K) in Wayanad split away to form their own force when the party joined hands with the Congress. Mr. Appachan is aware the resignation worked against him and has sought the voters' pardon. \"It was a political decision,\" he told  <i>The Hindu</i>  in Cheeral. \"At that time, there were compulsions. But I did good work in the four years I was there.\" The voters do not seem too forgiving, though. One wisecrack making the rounds is that Mr. Appachan took voluntary retirement from his job. And after VRS you cannot go back full time to the old slot. As the polls approach the third round, the CPI (M)'s Mr. Prasad seems right on top.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNext door, Shreyans Kumar of the LDF (from the Janata Dal) is strongly challenging the former Health Minister, K.K. Ramachandran, in the Kalpetta seat. The latter's image took a hit following a corruption scandal that forced his exit from the State Cabinet. Adding to this problem was the UDF's poor tackling of the agrarian crisis when he was a Minister from here. That crisis is now claiming not just the lives of farmers but those of their children as well. Many young people are forced to drop out of college due to their parents' bankruptcy. Some of them have also committed suicide.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAlso giving the UDF a run for its money is K.C. Kunhiraman (CPI-M) in the Mananthavady seat. He is up against P. Balan of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). The latter is a new entrant to the League. That he is accused of having earlier been close to the Hindu Right is causing some confusion amongst League voters. The popular Mr. Kunhiraman has won support amongst the Adivasis and could well cause an upset in this strong UDF seat.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nUpsets in Wayanad would have to occur against major odds. The Left did make inroads in both the Lok Sabha polls of 2004 and in the panchayats last year. But to wrest the Assembly seats here would mean the biggest upheaval yet. One tricky factor is the presence of smaller groups such as the Adivasi Gothra Mahasabha (AGM) in Mananthavady. There, the UDF hopes, C.K. Janu of the AGM will divide the tribal vote of Kunhiraman. In Sulthan Bathery, too, Farmers' Relief Forum (FRF) leader A.C. Varkey is in the arena.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nThe `VS factor'\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Varkey has been active on agrarian issues and got 35,000 votes when contesting the last Lok Sabha polls. He believes \"the fight is between me and Krishna Prasad. Appachan is trailing us.\" However, the most impact third players are likely to have is in splitting the vote. On the other hand, there is the \"VS factor.\" LDF leader and chief ministerial candidate V.S. Achuthanandan has toured the district. \"Our first priority is agriculture,\" he told  <i>The Hindu</i>  in Mananthavady. \"We will act firmly to revive this debt-ridden agrarian sector.\" His tour and its agrarian focus have had their own impact.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPepper fetched Rs. 270 a kg just a few years ago. Today, growers would find it hard to get much more than Rs. 60 a kg. Vanilla, once commanding prices touching Rs. 4,000 a kg, would be lucky to fetch over Rs. 130 a kg today. The coffee economy is in a shambles. That, in a district where it occupies close to 70,000 hectares and has some 60,000 small growers. Reaching Rs. 130 a kg a few years ago, the coffee price is now around Rs. 24 a kg and sliding. The better grades of cardamom have seen prices dip by 75 per cent and now clock around Rs. 200-Rs. 250 a kg. Tea prices too, are down the tube. Many plantation owners have simply walked away, deserting their workers. Hence the new trends in this long-time UDF bastion. But the winners will find that victory signals just the beginning of deadly, seemingly intractable problems.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

In another third, celebration. In the last part of his home there was preparation for both mourning and celebration. This Banjara household in Yavatmal had to conduct a funeral and three weddings in 24 hours. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPawar was the eldest brother and head of the extended family. The `bada-pitaji' or big father. \"In the Banjara samaj,\" says Mohan Jadhav, \"the eldest brother accepts a major role in the marriages of his kin. And he had to perform two that week.\" Jadhav is secretary of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS) and helped steer the family through its crisis. \"Gosavi was deep in debt. As every farmer here is. Yet, he tried to get the weddings done.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHe was also one of ten indebted farmers who killed themselves on May 9. And among the 520 who have taken their lives since June last year in the region's ongoing agrarian crisis. The distress driving the deaths reflects in everything from cancelled weddings to funerals. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPawar was deep in debt and had little money for the new farming season. He had even resorted to a `khande palat' to raise the crop loan he required. That is, `switching the burden from one shoulder to another.' He needed Rs.65,000 to work his seven acres. But owed the bank Rs.50,000, which he had to clear first. \"So,\" says Kishore Tiwari of the VJAS, \"he took the latter amount from a moneylender at a charge of Rs.2500 \u0097  for just one day. He cleared his bank debt with that, got the crop loan and repaid the lender. This means he was left with just Rs.12,500. And a new debt of Rs.65,000.\" Khande palat is common in the debt-ridden villages here. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGosavi Pawar went on May 8 from his village of Koljhari to the town of Mohada. The wedding of Savita, daughter of one brother, was set for May 9. That of Pramod, son of another brother, was fixed for May 10. But Pawar never returned. \"I first learned of his death from an auto driver,\" says his son Prakash. \"My father had gone to Mohada to buy the clothes, garments and other gifts for the weddings.\" But no merchant there was willing to extend him credit on the purchases. Already in despair over his debts, Pawar took his own life.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHe was brought to the post-mortem centre in Yavatmal town. The police wanted the body removed quickly \u0097  post-mortem centres in Vidharbha are busy places. But the grieving family needed to delay bringing him home. \"How could they bring a dead body to a house where a wedding was on?\" asks deputy sarpanch Tulsiram Chavan. So the body's return was slowed down until the <i>baraat</i> had left the house. Despite this, body and <i>baraat</i> met at a junction. Pawar's pallbearers moved away into a field, behind a cluster of trees to avoid contact. But the bride Savita wept, knowing it was her Kaka's last journey she was seeing at a distance.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere was still another wedding to go the next day. \"I wanted to postpone mine when I learned uncle was dead,' says the bridegroom, Pramod Pawar. \"But the village pointed out that the bride's family and others would be put to huge losses. More so because another couple's marriage was also tied to mine to save money.\" Vidharbha's crisis has seen many weddings called off. Few can afford them. The village elders knew that delay could mean cancellation. So, heartbroken, they went ahead. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We were so disturbed by my brother's suicide, we could not even attend to our guests,\" says Phulsingh, father of Pramod. \"I wanted to call it off.\" That's when the residents of this debt-burdened village came to their rescue in a moving show of solidarity. People as poor as the family and worse, contributed small sums and other help to see it through. \"We held a meeting that night to plan, and everybody chipped in,\" says deputy sarpanch Chavan. \"Some took charge of the cooking. Others looked after the guests. A few arranged the funeral, yet others the transport.\" And a village celebrated its grief. For many across this region, funerals and weddings now depend on the aid of neighbours whose economic condition might be more dismal than their own. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSavita was married on May 9. Her uncle's funeral took place the same evening. Her cousin Pramod's wedding took place on May 10, along with that of the last couple. The collective effort of the Banjara clans saw the family come through the ordeal. At least for now.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe 80-plus Banjara families in this `no-liquor' village have a collective debt of over Rs.22 lakh. Koljhari's agriculture is a picture of all that has gone wrong. Soaring costs, fake inputs, crashing output prices, growing debt, and a collapse of formal credit. As with many others, Pawar's tryst with Bt cotton also proved a disaster. His seven acres yielded just four quintals. A crippling loss. Meanwhile, most adults here \u0097  and quite a few who are not \u0097  have sought work under the national rural employment guarantee programme. But nothing has happened so far. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDebt-related suicides in Vidharbha show no sign of slowing down. \"Nor are they likely to,\" says Wamanrao Rathore in Koljhari. \"See, people have readied their fields for the new season. But no one has bought the inputs as yet. Who can afford them? The banks won't give them loans. How do they cultivate?\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe 520 suicides listed by the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti since last June is the highest number recorded here since 1998. The 306 since January means there's one every ten hours now. While farm suicides doubled almost every year between 2001-04, the leap since last November has been huge. That's when it became clear the government would not reverse the cut in cotton price it had announced. Last year, the state withdrew its `advance bonus' of Rs.500 a quintal. This brought down what the farmer received for cotton to the MSP of Rs.1700 a quintal. A move that has fed into and spurred disaster. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Vidharbha's register of suicides, Pawar is just another statistic. Number 499. For Prakash and widow Kamlabai, he was father and husband. And yet, his death was not a complete surprise. \"Yes. We feared he might do this,' says Prakash. \"Anyone in our condition could do this. I could also do this.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

But his appearance is awaited with the same anticipation. \"If he doesn't come, we're dead. If there's no `anna,' there's no cultivation,\" says Wamanrao Rathore in Koljhari village, Yavatmal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHis neighbours are far more focussed on `anna' showing up than on Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's visit to Vidharbha this week. Many here have reason to fear `anna.' But pray for his arrival all the same.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis `anna' (elder brother) is a not a naxalite. He's a moneylender. He's from outside the village \u0097  and the State. And like the local input dealers, he has become central to the lives and agriculture of people in Koljhari and many other villages. This type of creditor was barely known in the region a decade ago. His rise is tied to that of the agrarian crisis in Vidharbha. Now, as bank credit to small farmers shrinks further, he is crucial to their operations.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n`Anna' runs a home delivery system of loans. \"People like him come from Andhra Pradesh,\" says Bhima Kudamate, a Gond who took Rs.10,000 from him last season. \"I had to return Rs.15,000 in six months.\" That is, interest of 100 per cent. \"I sold my cotton but prices were so bad, I raised only Rs.10,000.\" However, `anna' has a home collection system, too. He grabbed all Kudamate's money and also seized his bullock cart and animals. \"Now I hire a pair of bullocks at Rs.1,000 a month.\" Yet, \"we need him. What options do we have?\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe lender from across the border shows up just before the start of the new farm season \u0097  late May or early June. And hands out loans of around Rs.10,000 or so. He might even lend money in August, but the interest begins from June. He cashes in by November. The pressure on his clients is enormous. Almost all have unpaid bank debts. Most owe money to their input dealers, as well. They also have pending cooperative society loans. And nearly everyone has borrowed cash from relatives. Too many here live by borrowing from one lender to pay off another. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n`Anna' feeds off this process. The failure of the banks carves the niche for his existence. He occupies the space vacated by other credit systems. Since the farmers have no option, `anna' can get away with being very harsh. \"He will take your cash, crop or assets. Or anything that catches his fancy,\" say the villagers. In one case, his fancy extended to the tin `patras' on a debtor's roof. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut what about their local <i>sahucar</i>? Grins and grimaces all around. \"He runs at the mention of a loan,\" says Harish Todasi. \"That is, ever since R.R. Patil began his crackdown on lenders. So now he won't even discuss a Rs.1,000 loan for a medical emergency.\" The action against loan sharks was ordered by the Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister some months ago. On the ground though, this police-led sweep has targeted only the small village lender. It does not touch far more crucial classes of usurers \u0097  such as input dealers. Those who sell seed, fertilizer, and pesticide at inflated rates. And who extend farmers credit on awful terms. Nor does it affect `anna.'\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Note that there is no punishment for banks that fail to heed government directives to increase credit to struggling small farmers,\" says Kishore Tiwari of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti. \"But the small creditor is under fire.\" This has led the little village lender to opt out of the process. And weddings and funerals are stuck for lack of money. Also, with so many clients going broke or committing suicide, lots of small moneylenders are themselves bankrupt.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe State Government says it will ensure that eight lakh of the 12 lakh farmers in the region will get crop loans from banks and cooperative societies for the coming season. But this count reduces the number of farmers by over half. \"Their own relief package of last year begins by speaking of 22 lakh affected farmers,\" says Kishore Tiwari. \"Which means the full figure is even higher. But suddenly, the total number becomes 12 lakh. And those they will help, just eight lakh. They're fiddling their own statistics. So you can guess how good their credit operations will be.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNo less problematic is the Rs.1,075-crore \"relief package\" announced last year for crisis-hit cultivators. More than three fourths of this was farmers' money being returned to them. That dates back to when the Cotton Federation would deduct three per cent of the minimum support price that growers received. This money went towards the Federation's capital formation fund \u0097  which helped that body raise loans from banks. Now, that's out. The government has gutted the fund to pay for its \"relief package.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven though it's their own money, farmers are getting relief cheques for absurd amounts. In Koljhari, upa sarpanch Tulsiram Chavan shows us one cheque that gives him `relief' \u0097  to the extent of Rs.78. Others speak of cheques of Rs.5. These won't be deposited since \"it's costlier to get to the bank and back.\" How could this happen? One reason is that many small growers, in bad years, could not sell their cotton to the federation. They had to sell to traders to whom they owed money, who then pocketed the federation's price. And so this year, the traders picked up the refunds meant for the farmers. After all, their names were on the sale records.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nChief Minister Deshmukh had clarified that for the coming season, all farmers would receive crop loans. He did this after complaints that banks were not giving such help to defaulters. In practice, though, the banks have not budged. \"How can people not default when they've had three, even four bad years,\" ask Koljhari's residents. \"Now if you punish us for that even this year, we're finished.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I cannot remember when I last purchased anything for my family,\" says Wamanrao Rathore. \"No new clothes, nothing. Price hikes have made farming too costly. Cotton prices don't let us break even. And the banks won't give us loans to grow anything this year.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The only hope we have is that man from Andhra Pradesh,\" says Raju Rathore, sarpanch of Ambejhani.

Could this possibly have something to do with the Prime Minister's arriving here shortly? Officials are rushing out to pay compensation to suicide-hit families whom they have ignored for months, even years. Villagers likely to have VIPs visit are being coached in their lines. (With compensation being handed over at about the same time.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere will have been more than 600 farm suicides before Prime Minster Manmohan Singh sets foot in the region. And that's only since June last year. For once, the suicide index gets near equal billing with the Sensex. (Well not quite, and only for a week.) A top bureaucrat from Mumbai warned cowering minions in Nagpur that suicides `must stop' by the month-end. That's an order. (How simple that sounds. And if it is, why did they not turn off the tap earlier?) Some officials, ordered out into the villages, have phoned journalists to ask: \"Where should we go?\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n`Guardian Ministers' are visiting places they've never heard of or seen in years. `Briefs' are being prepared for Ministers whose attention span is well described by that very word. The Governor himself has hopped over to the region. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe poor Banjara household that saw three weddings and a funeral in 24 hours ( <i>The Hindu</i> , May 22, 2006) had important visitors this week. They had none at all at the time of their tragedy on May 9 or any day since. They are now getting Rs.1 lakh. Earlier, compensation was denied to the most genuine cases of suicides driven by agrarian distress. To the extent that an angry High Court rattled the State Government more than once. This week, compensations are being paid out with little or no verification at all. Time is of the essence. Get things under control for when Dr. Manmohan Singh is here. This is what matters most. The State has figured out a vital point the Prime Minister's visit implies. For long the Chief Minister and Union Agriculture Minister have suggested that All's Quiet on the Western Front. Dr. Singh's visit calls that into question. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOnly a month ago, the Chief Minister wrote on the front page of the <i>Maharashtra Times</i> to rebut pesky journalists out to smear the Shangri-La his regime had so lovingly built. His first target was distinguished journalist Govind Talwalkar (editor of that newspaper for 27 years). A distressed Mr. Talwalkar had scorched the State over its failure on the farm crisis. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor his pains, the well-known editor was mocked for handing out advice while residing (after retirement) in the United States. There is rich irony in this. Mr. Talwalkar's physical distance from Maharashtra is far less than Mr. Deshmukh's mental distance from Vidharbha. The brief visits made by the Chief Minister to the region saw several farmers take their lives during the very hours he was there. Meanwhile, Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar insisted that, on average, the number of farm suicides in the country was `normal.' Both now seem far more concerned about the farm deaths. Perhaps due to the growing sense that their relief `packages' are more about packaging, less about relief. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTo that extent, the Prime Minister's visit to Vidharbha has had an impact even before he's reached the place. It would, however, be a limited and transient impact if he does not see through the charade. Cracking down \u0097  as will surely happen \u0097  on officers in Vidharbha for their `failure' is an evasion. The mess there starts right at the top. The lower orders merely toe the line their bosses lay down. Vidharbha's condition is the product of design, not decay. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is no need to rediscover the main reasons for farm suicides. You can leave that sort of quibble to media and market analysts. Governments know why they are happening. Large numbers of such suicides have also occurred in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Punjab, and elsewhere. Besides, Vidharbha has seen a lot of `suicide or distress tourism' from official quarters. This came after the visit of the National Commission on Farmers whose findings are too hard for government to swallow. (Even now, there is a National Commission for Farmers draft national policy for farmers inviting comment and debate. It is not a closed matter nor a secret document. It's up on their website and goes beyond relief and immediate steps. You can agree, disagree, attack, suggest alternatives. But there is not a word on this at the top. A debate is not welcome.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOver a dozen teams of one kind or another have since landed up here to produce one report or another. The hope, in part, was that someone would throw up a report soft on the government. That did not happen and most were damaging. However, needless time was wasted even as hundreds of more farmers took their own lives. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's also clear that too many in power do not want to look at the reports of the NCF. These contain sound advice on some of the vital issues. A bit of this advice, alas, runs counter to market fundamentalist theology and thus cannot be entertained. Agriculture is no longer just a hostage to the monsoon. It is held to ransom by a mightily rigged Market. And there is direct personal gain for many making decisions. In this State, where so many in power are among those who profit from farmer misery. And at the centre, where lobbyists of the World Bank and WTO within government also get to line their pockets nicely, thank you. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAll in all, Dr. Singh's visit to Vidharbha has set off a process that has the State Government on its clumsy toes. Yet, there's a long way to go. The visit raises hopes \u0097  from a trough to a new high. From their State Government, people in that region have learned the hard way to expect little. The massive numbers of suicides, after all, also speak of a breakdown in trust. A total loss of faith. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Prime Minister's visit could well re-kindle the dying embers. But then it's got to deliver. Or the outcome will be most painful. Ever since he said he intends to visit the region, the pressure has been on to hijack his tour schedule. Demands to open memorials to eminently forgettable people. To address meetings and visit ashrams. Fair enough \u0097  that's part of the game. It will be a sad game though, if this does happen. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nSending out a message\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWere Dr. Singh to focus on agrarian distress and nothing but, his visit would at least send out a message. To the people of Vidharbha and Maharashtra. To the State Government. Maybe even to his own Cabinet colleagues. Yet, it's got to go beyond such a statement. What he announces at the end of his trip must meet the most basic demands of farmers here. And elsewhere too. Leave aside long-term solutions for the moment. The bandaids had better be good. The higher the hopes are, the harder they'll fall. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor weeks now, those in power have bristled at the very mention of a loan waiver. Yet, it has got to happen. Even the colonial Raj, with all its cruelty, did take such steps in times of acute mass misery. And like it or not, it will happen at some stage. Not just in this region, but across the country for farmers who have been destroyed by policy. In any case, there is not a murmur of protest when tens of thousands of crores of NPAs are written off for a handful of industrialists. But write off the tiny amounts of millions of farmers? That's heresy.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, intense lobbying is on. One plea is that all problems would be solved if irrigation in Vidharbha were set right at once. Sure, irrigation is a major issue. It does need a focus. One that is sustainable and affordable to the farmer. That's hard to do in today's Maharashtra. And is made almost impossible by that regressive piece of legislation: The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act. This World Bank driven Act makes it impossible for small (even big) farmers anywhere in the State to afford irrigation in the future. ( <i>The Hindu</i> , April 27 &amp; 28, 2005)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt would be nice to see a few of the region's eight irrigation projects, some pending for decades, completed. But such schemes in this State have seen cost overruns of several hundred per cent long before completion. In the Tembhu project in Karad, as a devastating <i>NDTV</i> report pointed out, the cost of irrigation could be well over Rs.20,000 an acre. What happens when the new Act kicks in? Watch this space.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDebt waiver. Fresh crop loans based on current costs. A new line of credit. Urgent help with free and cheap inputs. Return of the `advance bonus' and a proper minimum support price for cotton. Steps to stabilise prices. Higher state procurement. Duties to prevent dumping. These are just a few of the measures Dr. Singh could and should announce in Vidharbha. They won't solve the problem, but will reduce the misery. What he finally does will have an impact not just on that region, but on Indian farming as a whole.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<url></url><web></web></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006062804211000.htm&amp;date=2006/06/28/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2006/06/28/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehinduclassifieds.com/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindujobs.com/\">Jobs</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2006062804231000.htm\">V.P.

Gee, another committee. Just what we needed. Who knows, it might even do something, like form a sub-committee. But the joy might be hard to sustain. It's all part of a `package.' That too is not a new thing. Governments in this country have handled more packages than FedEx. My all-time favourite is the Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput or KBK package, which has outlasted four Prime Ministers and seen more variations than Rubik's Cube. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEvery imaginable programme for which funds already exist has been merged or purged from the KBK development package at some point. A Rs.4,750 crore package swelled to Rs.6,500 crore over a decade. Of which only Rs.360 crore actually showed up till 2004. Even from that paltry sum, money was diverted for the total literacy programme. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe `package' declared at the end of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's trip to Vidharbha will have little or no impact on the crisis there. Neither in the short run nor in the long term. The visit's political fallout is another matter. No one can now deny a major agrarian crisis exists. Dr. Singh's journey thoroughly exposed the Maharashtra Government and the Union Agriculture Ministry. It also brought \u0097  if for a week \u0097  some media focus on the crisis. Well on the farm suicides, at least. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet the suicides are the effect, not the cause, of a much wider agrarian distress. The death count is not the story but a window to it. There are millions of farm households across the country that have not seen suicides but whose conditions are similar to those that have. They too are in deep trouble.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet the question will be asked \u0097  will farmers' suicides in Vidharbha halt now that there's a financial `package' to bring it relief? The answer is no. The deaths do have seasonal highs and lows. But a relative decline now would have little to do with the measures announced at the end of the Prime Minister's visit. The number of suicides in the 10-day run-up to his trip: 34. The number in 10 days after he left: 34. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt was no one's case that farm suicides would end with the visit. But people wanted steps that would slow the bleeding and restore hope. That did not happen.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nAdvance bonus\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe first thing the Prime Minister could have done or made the State Government do, was to restore the `advance bonus' of Rs.500 a quintal for cotton. The State withdrew this in May 2005. Appeals by growers \u0097  and even by the National Commission on Farmers (NCF) \u0097  were ignored. We knew all hell would break loose. It did. If suicide numbers were high when the price of cotton was Rs.2,250, how could things get better when it fell to Rs.1,700 a quintal? That too due to state policy? (There is also no mention in the new deal of a `price stabilisation fund' called for by the NCF to protect farmers against the shock of plummeting prices.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe final `package' ignored this vital demand. Nor did it announce a debt waiver though many in power know there is no escape from such a measure. Some government of India will have to do this at some point. Sure, it would draw flak and cries of `fiscal imprudence' from the ideologically devout. (Though, when tens of thousands of crores are written off for a handful of industrialists, that is barely reported. Unlike that pampered lot, farmers have landed where they are due to policies hostile to agriculture for over a decade.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHad there been a waiver of debt of up to just Rs.25,000, more than 80 per cent of Vidharbha's farmers would no longer have owed the banks money. People thought that waiver would come. It didn't and the sense of being let down is great. This matters across the country, too. Indebtedness amongst farm households has almost doubled in the past decade. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe good aspect of the `package' was, of course, the promise of crop loans to all farmers across the board. This could help many tide over the current season. But the interest waiver of Rs.712 crore mainly helps banks that have been hostile to farm lending. And some of the banks were anyway looted by the rich barons of the ruling elite, not by poor farmers. The move does not put a new rupee in the farmer's pocket. Since the principal amount has not been waived, the debt crisis will renew itself rapidly. Besides, there is no help with seed or other inputs. Not even a promise of it.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe package gives Rs.2177 crore to 82 major and medium and 442 minor irrigation projects in the six districts it covers. Much of this simply revises book entries. That is, it draws money from existing programmes. If all these schemes were completed tomorrow, they would not add three per cent of acreage to irrigated area. That, in a region where irrigated land adds up to just 11 per cent of the total. Sure, people want water. But all problems are not due to lack of irrigation. Distress suicides have occurred in irrigated parts of Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere was and is total silence on the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act, 2005. This regressive law puts irrigation beyond the reach of all except corporate farmers. It could raise irrigation costs by thousands of rupees per acre. It also allows an unelected authority to compel farmers to use drip or sprinkler irrigation. Those unable to pay the huge rate hikes in the offing could face fines of up to ten times the new charges. They could also face six months imprisonment. And yes, farmers with more than two children pay one and a half times those rates anyway. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe new package is silent on this. It has nothing for the 85 per cent non-irrigated farmers now shut out from even the chance of having that facility. Its gift of Rs.225 crore for horticulture and Rs.87 crore for drip irrigation will touch only those who already have access to water. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is also not a whisper of incentives for food crops in the `package.' The rebirth of jowar would have helped farmer, soil, and food security. Suicides are far higher among cash crop farmers than among food crop growers here. It would also have seen the revival of livestock \u0097  jowar is where the fodder comes from. Instead, there is Rs.180 crore for \"seed replacement.\" This sounds like gifting big bucks to people pushing Bt and other exotic seed that would further ruin farmers here. The same sum could have been used for an incentive of Rs.1000 per acre for growing jowar. Instead, we got notions like gifting a thousand high yielding cows to farmers in each of six districts here. For those with no access to fodder and struggling to feed their families, these cows will eat them out of hearth and home. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the Maharashtra Government has raised its own `relief package' for Vidharbha farmers from Rs.1075 crore to over Rs.1300 crore. Since no one ever took this deal seriously, it matters little. The first commissioner in charge of this `package' left after weeks, disbursing nothing. He was never given the money to do so. His replacement had barely unpacked his bags when he went off to do poll duty in Tamil Nadu. So months passed with nothing happening. Except, of course, the suicides. Those kept happening.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the Union Agriculture Ministry, feeling left out, kept threatening its own `package' for some months. Then it said it had drawn up one that the Prime Minister would announce in Vidharbha. Like the Prime Minister was its postman or PRO. Still, it meant there was one more `package' in the running. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNone of these has a word on the strengthening of cotton procurement by the state machinery. With big corporations now free to directly buy and sell in any quantities they wish, prices will be steadily pushed down by cartels. The media focus, of course, is on the initial `higher price' they seem to offer. So it's barely noticed that the price takes a dive very soon after. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSadly, what might have been a useful short-term remedy was drowned in flawed national policy that remains anti-farmer. Dragged down by double standards on `fiscal imprudence.' Never allowed to meet people's real needs. The `Vidharbha package' also ran aground on the rocky shores of State politics. Who would get the `credit' for bringing relief? Who would land the blame for years of neglect? Not a single top leader of Maharashtra had entered a grieving household prior to the Prime Minister's visit. So his doing so would be a real problem, disgracing them in the public eye. That saw a gang-up to undermine the tour and its agenda.

He profiles the character of the creditor, captures the pathos of the debtor. He describes the interest mechanism and how it is manipulated. Adhao brings in the local features of <i>sahucari</i> in the Amravati-Akola belt. Here, there is no mortgage. You just give the lender a straight deed of sale for your land. In theory, he returns the land when you pay up. In truth, he holds on to it even after you have paid up. In fact, he demands more money.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAdhao is neither an academic studying the problem nor a reporter digging into the issue. Just a small farmer who lost all his land this way and whose suicide note is meticulous in detail. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We sent a fax to Home Minister R.R. Patil,\" says Udhav Adhao, a relative. \"So far, nothing has happened. When he was alive and made a complaint, the police arrested him, not the <i>sahucar</i>.\" That's because \"he tried to prevent the latter from cutting down trees on the land grabbed from him,\" says Ashok, the dead man's son. \"Each time my father paid off some money, the <i>sahucar</i> raised his demand.\" Adhao's widow Babytai is too distressed to say a word at their home in Khirala village, Amravati district.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The more the banking system denies the farmer aid, the more he must go to the <i>sahucar</i>,\" says Vijay Jawandia, farm activist and leader. \"People thought that after the Prime Minister's visit, they could go to their bank and get a fresh crop loan. For many, this did not happen.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Wardha district, the suicide note of Ramkrishna Lonkar of Susandara village has grabbed attention in the local press. In it, Lonkar writes, \"After the Prime Minister's visit and announcements of a fresh crop loan, I thought I could live again.\" In fact, he was rebuffed at every stage when he began the process of seeking that loan. The talk at the top was not matched by credit at the bottom. \"I was shown no respect,\" he says in his note. Lonkar took his life on August 1, a month after Dr. Manmohan Singh's visit to the Vidharbha region.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Bankers are not going to give out fresh loans even after the interest waiver,\" says Mr. Jawandia. \"They know that farmers who could not pay back Rs.10,000 earlier cannot repay Rs.20,000 now. The more so when there is no change in the price of cotton. There is some logic in that. That's why a loan waiver is vital. It lets the farmer start with a clean slate.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOfficials admit the amounts involved in a possible waiver are quite small for a State like Maharashtra. \"The total advances for all these six districts is a little over Rs.1,200 crore,\" says one. (That figure does not include the interest.) \"Tamil Nadu has waived five times that amount for its farmers.\" There's more. \"If Rs.712 crore was the interest burden, when the advances are around Rs.1,200 crore, that's shocking. It argues the original loans were very small. The burden has been too great for too long.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"If you look at the amount taken away from farmers thanks to bad pricing and low import duties on cotton,\" says Mr. Jawandia, \"this is a trifling sum.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nInput costs, however, have not been trifling. In some estimates, Bt cotton now accounts for 50-60 per cent of the total sown area. Even after the fall in its price, it costs much more than non-Bt seed. And despite all the claims made for it, input dealers here have seen no decline in pesticide sales as a result of its use. Some claim higher sales than before. If there is any fall now, it might be due to excess rain crippling farm operations. And many farms have reported failure with Bt anyway, long before the downpour.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNew `indicators'\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the end, Adhao goes down as No. 650 in the list of farmers taking their lives since June 1, 2005. Lonkar was No. 702. Meanwhile, the official figure for suicides since 2001 has changed and confused many. One reason the total figure has shot up suddenly is that the State Government \"has changed the indicators. And it has changed them with retrospective effect,\" says a top official. So the number now is 1,864 suicides since 2001 in the six affected districts.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn mid-2005, the State was still speaking of a total of 141 distress suicides since 2001. When challenged in court, this number changed to 524 \u0097  State-wide. Then when the National Commission on Farmers came visiting last October, the Government told the Commission there had been over 300 in that period in a single district \u0097  not State-wide. That was Yavatmal and the data showed that the deaths had doubled each year since 2001. Which undid the claim that the rate of suicides was \"normal.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the State Assembly in December, the Government admitted to a figure of 1,041 farmers' suicides State-wide since 2001. Today, for the same period, it accepts a figure of 1,864 \u0097  in just six districts (Maharashtra has 35). Till late last year, it stuck to a definition of distress farm suicides that excluded very large numbers of people from its list. For instance, if a cultivator took his life but the family land was in his father's name \u0097  this was not a \"farmer's suicide.\" The claim was that \"since there was no land in the name of the deceased, he or she was not a farmer,\" points out the official.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe State's list also required that each case be judged by over 40 indicators before being declared a farm suicide. It was reported at the time (<i>The Hindu</i>, June 25, 2005) that this kept out many deaths from the Government's list. It also meant that the bereaved families would get no compensation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n In recent months, the State has revised its approach. Now, such a tragedy in a farm household is acknowledged as a farmer's suicide even if that family member had no land in his or her name. The result: hundreds of names have been added to the list from the 2001-05 period. There have been other changes, too.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe rain lashing Vidharbha is making things much worse. A lot of those who borrowed money to buy their inputs have seen their efforts washed away. For many, it will be difficult to recover from the accumulated losses of successive seasons.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

They say this is to punish those who have not paid water charges. But the whole village suffers.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd so this village of 635 people, mainly Adivasis, in Yavatmal district finds itself trapped. \"People cannot even sell land to meet their needs,\" says Chavan. \"The government blocks them at the land records office. So until their dues are settled, they cannot sell.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe dues can be odd, too. \"We had our own well,\" says Rambhau Sadashiv Mahajan. He is one of the slightly better off landowners here. The canal runs through his land. \"They insisted I pay their charges,\" says Mahajan. \"I told them I am using my well, not your canal. But they said: `If it runs by your land, you have to pay. Never mind which water you are using'.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Then,\" says Chavan, \"we got demands from both irrigation and revenue people. Meanwhile, charges that had started at Rs.65 a hectare rose rapidly till they came to the Rs.500 stage. Now think what damage this new law will that do.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Bill was passed by the State Assembly on April 16. Most farmers across the State remain unaware of the bill or its meaning. Those learning about it are stunned and angered. \"Everybody is already in debt,\" says ex-sarpanch Sumitra Ingole in Talegaon, Amravati. \"Who has the money?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBack in Maregaon, Chavan points out: \"This village lost canal water because people were too poor to pay the old charges. The rates plus fines crossed Rs.1 lakh for us and it got impossible.\" Rambhau Mahajan had to pay the equivalent of one acre of land \u0097  Rs.25,000 \u0097  in order to be able to sell four acres to survive.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nHike in water charges\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Bill signals massive hikes in water charges. The new rates will reflect \"full recovery of the cost of irrigation management, administration, operation and maintenance.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Farmers could be forced to adopt drip or sprinkler irrigation in some regions. Those with more than two children have to pay one and a half times the new rates. But how did this bill get through the legislature?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) legislator, Narasaiah Adam, had blasted the Bill when it was introduced in the Nagpur session of the Assembly last year. Following his salvo, the Bill was referred to a joint committee of both Houses. \"But no CPI or CPI-M MLA or MLC was included in it,\" he points out. (However, the PWP's Ganpatrao Deshmukh was on the committee.) The joint committee did more than approve the Bill. While it added phrases such as `equity,' it also brought in the two-child norm. And even made some clauses more stringent.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Mumbai this year, the revised Bill was rushed through by voice vote on April 16, the last day of the session. \"They brought in perhaps 16 bills on the last day,\" says Adam. \"And this one came in around 6 p.m.\" It was chaotic. \"This did not allow the bills to be read, let alone debated.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt was much the same in the Legislative Council, says the Shiva Sena MLC, Neelam Gorhe. \"Many bills came up late on the last day. These included the water bill and even one denying workers in essential services the right to strike. So our leader said let us extend the session and work another two or three days. Instead, the government just rammed the laws through by voice vote.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nDebt crisis\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBack in Vidharbha, the debt crisis faced by the farmers is obvious. There is very little sign of celebration though it is Ram Navami the day we visit Yavatmal. No one has money to spend.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"It is not right in any way,\" says Nitin Khadse, upa sarpanch of Jalka village. \"Poor families always have more children. More hands to work and earn. Why punish them? And with these costs those who have no irrigation will never get it. We will not accept this law.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The Bill not being seriously debated in the Assembly was shameful,\" says economist H.N. Desarda. The former State Planning Board member demands \"a much wider public debate on the issue. There is no trace in this bill of what Maharashtra's agriculture so badly needs. Drought-proofing and protective irrigation, for instance. There is a crying need for a sustained state role in water resources development as a whole. Instead they force an extreme market model of an anti-poor nature.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNarasaiah Adam vows a battle in the next session. \"This Bill must be recalled for proper debate and action. We will compel them to bring it back to the House.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Maregaon, sarpanch Chavan gives us a brief tour of the dead canal. \"For this we were hit by both irrigation and revenue departments. Both claim taxes on it and we are told to pay.\" For them, it's <i>Lagaan</i> without the cricket match. But other forms of resistance could be in the offing. \"We are already bankrupt ... We cannot pay. Let them try to make us.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

It went dead then. There's no water anyway to pump. We still get the minimum charge bill, though. The arrears are over Rs. 10,000.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n That is for a pumpset that has not worked one hour in 14 years. When his brother committed suicide last year, his chief concern was debt, not power.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nGovernment's \"sop\"\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn just two months after the then Maharashtra Chief Minister, Sushilkumar Shinde, announced \"free power\" for the State's farmers in 2004, there were some 80 farmers' suicides in the Vidharbha region. And that is from a very flawed accounting of the tragedy. The deaths did not stop though the free power theme stayed on the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party election manifesto in October.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMost of the farmers taking their lives never owned a pumpset and \"free power\" had no meaning for them. Perhaps less than 10 per cent of Vidharbha's farmers own pumpsets at all. And some of these were run on diesel, not electricity. However, rising prices placed diesel, too, out of reach for many.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the worst-hit district of Yavatmal, the largest number ever of farm suicides took place in the 10-month period after \"free power\" came in. This year, Yavatmal saw 29 farm suicides by May \u0097  before the agricultural season began. So power was not the trigger. And the deaths have gone on since then too. If anything, there have been fewer after free power was stopped by Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in May. Which suggests there is no great link between the suicides and free power.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Free power has never been a demand of farmers in this State,\" points out Ashok Dhawale, general secretary of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha. \"Not of the Kisan Sabha, nor of any other farmers' bodies. However, both Sena-BJP and Congress-NCP governments have pushed this as a major issue. In doing so, they are just hiding their own failures. They never addressed the far more basic needs and concerns of the farmers. Credit, water, stable power, lower input costs and fair prices.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Shinde announced his \"sop\" on August 4, 2004. The same day, four farmers took their lives in Yavatmal, Akola, Akot and Amravati. \"Even as he was speaking, people were killing themselves,\" says Jaideep Hardikar, a Nagpur-based journalist. Mr. Hardikar has covered the suicides for years. Mr. Shinde was acting quickly to counter Bal Thackeray's promise of free power to farmers if the Shiv Sena won the polls.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nChief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh stopped \"free power\" for farmers on May 10. He said the Shinde Government had given it \"in view of drought and suicides by farmers\" but things had changed now. However, water problems have increased in the last year. And suicides occurred in better irrigated parts of this region, too. Or in parts which got good rainfall. Yavatmal, for instance, got over 900 mm in 2003. Yet it saw dozens of suicides that year.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOf the 10 households surveyed by  <i>The Hindu</i>  last week, four had seen suicides before August 2004. That is, before the \"free power\" period. Another four suffered them after the coming of free power. The last two occurred after its withdrawal. Of the 10 victims, nine had not owned a pumpset anytime in the past three years. Three had owned 3 HP sets between four and 10 years ago. Six households \u0097  like that of Prabhakar Khatale \u0097  had never seen one. \"It's pointless,\" says Vasantrao Chavan, in Mulawa village, Yavatmal. His nephew Abhay Shamrao was the only one of the 10 suicide victims who owned a working pumpset within the past three years. \"There is no water. What will you pump?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The cotton federation's delays in paying our dues are a worse headache than power,\" says Rameshwar Chardi. A farmer in Waifad village, Wardha, he points to the deadly cycle this sets off. \"They don't pay the dues, we can't feed our families. Without the money, we cannot repay our loans. Without that, we won't get new loans. This means we're crippled in the next season.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBesides, when farmers take their produce to the federation, it deducts bank dues from their payments. In short, says Vijay Jawandia a farmer's leader in Wardha, \"a body set up to aid farmers serves as a loan recovery arm of the banks. Why should it?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs Suresh Deshmukh points out: \"Because of this, many don't take cotton to the federation. So we have no choice but to sell to private traders.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Which means far lower prices. His brother had sold cotton at Rs.1,600 a quintal to traders. That, when the minimum support price was Rs. 2,300. This sets off the whole debt cycle again. Even now, the federation owes lakhs of farmers two instalments of dues. If paid, they could buy inputs for the new season without turning to moneylenders.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOther reasons driving the crisis are the same as those in Andhra Pradesh or Kerala. Input prices are rising and output prices crashing. Debt is soaring. \"Not only is the cost of production going up,\" says Vijay Jawandia, \"so is the cost of living. Health, transport, all other items. Globalisation and liberalisation have had a deadly impact. Earlier when production failed, prices rose. Now, even when the crop fails, prices go down.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCollapse of rural credit\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRural credit has collapsed. \"Interest rates are higher in this sector than any other. Even now, if you buy a 3 HP motor, you end up paying 18 per cent interest. Contrast that with housing loans or car loans.\" And, just when he needs it the most \"the State has turned its back on the farmer.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet free power became the talking point of the elections. Issues far more deadly have been sidelined. For instance, the Congress-NCP manifesto spoke of an assured price for cotton of Rs.2,700 a quintal. But this year's price is unlikely to exceed Rs.1,980. This means most farmers face losses before they have sown the first seed. Nor has any assurance on irrigation been fulfilled. The elections are over. But Vidharbha pays the price of power. Power of the political kind.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

Maharashtra is not the first State. It won't be the last. The drive towards privatisation of water in this country was planned by the World Bank in the 1990s. The just-passed Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Bill reeks of Bank edicts already out in 1998. In that year, the \"The Irrigation Sector\" report of the Bank (teamed up with the Indian Government) laid down the line.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt listed things that \"need to be urgently put into practice.\" Among them: \"drastically increasing and rationalising the current water rates.\" The rest of its \"urgent needs\" were the standard Bank rules for the capture of a country's farming by corporations. In pushing brutal hikes, the Bank was frank. Its report opposed gradual hikes. \"The more recent experience is that `a big bang' approach may be better.\" Laughably, it cites Andhra Pradesh and Mexico as among the success stories of that approach. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nThe Latin American experience\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLatin America is strewn with the corpses of economies and governments that went for the `big bang' approach. Water, especially, has been a giant factor in the rage of peoples there against regimes. This year, <i>The New York Times</i> ran a front-page piece on the collapse of privatised water services across Latin America. Being the <i>Times</i>, it coyly sidestepped any criticism of corporations. Or even of the basic concepts themselves. But it did measure the Big Bang. In Andhra Pradesh, the voters threw in a bang of their own last May. You'd think we'd learn something from all this.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet the new Maharashtra bill does not stray from the righteous path. It too, regurgitates the same jargon and ideas imposed by the Bank and its pet politicians and paid-for bureaucrats on the people of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNever mind that both States saw giant disasters in that sector. Orissa's sham (Bank-made) `pani panchayats' shattered poor farmers in Angul district. They also handed over irrigation to a small bunch of rich landlords. (`Little pani, less panchayats'  <i>The Hindu</i>  Sunday Magazine September 15 and 22, 2002.) In Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu's regime passed an order that aimed for much of what the Maharashtra bill now does. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\n`Water users'\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Andhra Pradesh, too, a farce of `Water Users Associations' was set up to the applause of the Bank. Indeed, \"The Irrigation Sector\" report lavishly praises the Andhra Pradesh `example.' The term `water users' itself is intriguing. Are the rest of us non-users? Some kind of dry land bacilli? The cheers for Mr. Naidu's good example came even as his Government sold cleaned and treated water to soft drinks companies at 25 paise a litre in Hyderabad. That, at a time, when most colonies of the city were getting water for half an hour once every two days.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile the `users' groups proved user-friendly. They sidelined elected panchayats. The rich have always found democracy tiresome. So favoured were these groups that James Wolfensohn came all the way to Andhra Pradesh for them. To inaugurate a confederation of water users associations in 2000. He was to do this at the Koil Sagar Dam in Mahbubnagar. Alas, large mobs of angry `non-users' furious at the loss of their water, blocked the highway. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe `users,' far fewer in number, were given a run for their money and their limbs. Mr. Wolfensohn could not reach the site.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut if Muhammad can't go to the mountain, the mountain must go to Muhammad. The Naidu Government, famed for its efficiency in these matters, shifted the dam. In name, anyway. It took down the dam's plaque and flew it to a safe venue. Away from the ugly baying of non-users. There it had a sham of an inaugural in hiding. All this happened under the `liberal' Wolfensohn. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs against the `hardliner' Paul Wolfowitz coming in now. It doesn't really matter, though, which Wolf is at the door, <i>canis lupis</i> or <i>canis rufus</i>. The family <i>Canidae</i> are predatory by nature.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHow did the Bank view the mess in Andhra Pradesh? As the \"remarkable strength of government commitment in Andhra Pradesh to irrigation sector reform.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nIdentical jargon\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMaharashtra seems set to outdo that level of commitment. This bill parrots all the pet phrases of the Bank. It dittos the ideas, rules and structures that the Bank's own vision lays out. In parts, the jargon is near identical. But it breaks some new ground. `Entitlement' in this bill is not defined as the right or claim of a citizen or community. Here it means `any authorisation by any river basin agency to use the water for the purposes of this act.' In short, the entitlements of authority, not of society, are what drive the bill. The bill also equates private companies with citizens. The section on State Water Planning is clear on this. \"The expression `person' shall include individual, group of individuals, all local authorities, association, societies, companies etc.,\" In short, petty officials and giant corporates will have the same rights as citizens and farmers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nHuge costs involved\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt warns that in some regions, \"Water shall not be made available from the canal ... \" Not \"unless the cultivator adopts drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation ...\" Or whatever the authority orders. This could add Rs. 15-20,000 per acre to the farmers' costs for just installation. Running costs would be a further burden. This is a rip-off. Well-known private companies close to the ruling outfit will strike gold. The State might even buy this equipment from them in the name of subsidies to the farmer. Even if the farmer cannot cope with running costs.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe new Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority \"shall consist of a chairperson and two other members.\" The chair will be of Chief Secretary rank. Of the other two, one \"shall be an expert from the field of water resources engineering.\" The other, likewise, \"in the field of water resources economy.\" There's another open door for the private sector \u0097  right on the top floor. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis body will ensure that \"water charges shall reflect the full recovery of the cost of irrigation management, administration, operation and maintenance of water resources project.\" Also hidden in the deal is a clause that sailed through when the bill was first passed by the Legislative Council. That talks of partial \"recovery of capital investment.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThese levels of cost recovery are aimed at clearing the way for private investors. The Maharashtra bill, as economist and former State Planning Board member H.M. Desarda points out, could make costs unbearable. Perhaps as much as Rs. 8,000 an acre. That would simply evict lakhs of small holders from farming. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome of those who back the bill, like MLC B.T. Deshmukh, point out that it gives priority to backward regions. That new projects must come first to hard-hit Vidharbha and Marathwada. True, the terms of the bill do imply this. And so? It's like if the Bombay Gymkhana were to give first preference in membership to those living in the slums of Dharavi. Sure, they'd get priority. Could they afford an `nth' of the charges?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nTwo-child norm\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe uproar on the bill centred around the obnoxious two-child norm. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. On April 28, M.P. Veerendrakumar drew the Lok Sabha's attention to  <i>The Hindu</i> 's reports on the subject during a discussion on the Finance Bill. \"Marginalised farmers and those who take agriculture as a livelihood will be driven out. The field will be entirely open for big tycoons and MNCs... \" \"Whenever agriculture issues are raised in the House,\" he argued \"the reply is that it is a State subject.\" But he points out, \"the moment some bureaucrat goes to some country, he signs an international agreement.\" With whose authority, he demanded to know. He believes a constitutional amendment is needed to root out the secrecy, intrigue and plain old corruption that are tied with such legislation. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe distribution of water already stands privatised in parts of several towns across the country. But applied to farming, will it work? Can such massive rates be recovered? Absolutely not. No one can pay. So why bother, then? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBecause it will destroy countless small farmers. It will establish, yet again, water as a private good not as a human right. (What impact the costs will have on food prices has not even been looked at.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt will hand over agriculture to the rich and corporations. It will worsen the terrible situation of poor farmers in the State \u0097  amongst whom there have been hundreds of suicides. And it will doubtless be touted as a national and global `model.' Watch out for that big bang. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

The Regulatory Authority it sets up will have three full-time members. Not one of them is required to be a farmer.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Elected panchayats are sidelined on water issues. Farmers with more than two children will pay one and a half times the high new rates. And in some regions, costly drip and sprinkler irrigation will become mandatory. Breaking these laws invites six months in prison and a fine of ten times the annual water charges.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nShock and anger\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarmers greeted news of the bill with shock and anger across Vidharbha. This is one of the least irrigated and most backward regions of Maharashtra. One that has seen hundreds of farmers' suicides in the past few years. In Parbhani, Marathwada, the State camp of the All-India Kisan Sabha called for the Bill's repeal. It also declared May 5 as a day of Statewide protest to press this demand.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNo farmer we spoke to in four districts across Vidharbha knew of the Bill. Much less that it had been passed by the legislature. Even Agriculture Department officials seemed baffled by it. \"We cannot pay the present charges,\" says Vijay Kophe of Borgaon village in Amravati district. \"How will we pay these new ones? Our water, their taxes?\" Kophe owns a little over two acres and has three children.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"How many can afford drip or sprinkler irrigation,\" asks an amazed Gajanand Kumble, another farmer with an even smaller holding. \"Where do they think the money will come from?\" It will simply \"give industry a giant captive market,\" scoffs Vijay Jawandia in Wardha.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"What link is there between irrigation and children,\" asks Bhojraj Raut, sarpanch of Bathkuli village in Amravati. Labourer Gulabrao Nesram even finds it funny. \"What about those with two children but no land? Will they be rewarded?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nAgricultural crisis\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLike most villages in Vidharbha, this one too, is in the grip of an agricultural crisis and deep in debt. \"The village failed to pay electricity bills of about Rs. 1 lakh,\" says the sarpanch. \"So the power was cut off, the pumps are down and we cannot get even drinking water.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Why not fine the government,\" asks teacher R.M. Bhagywanth. \"They have not paid cotton growers here dues of Rs.2,300 crores. How will people pay any bills without that? This law will push up suicides one hundred times.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nB.T. Deshmukh, an independent member of the legislative council from Amravati, defends the law. He was on the Joint Committee of both houses to which the prickly Bill was referred.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n After making several changes \u0097  and bringing in the two-child norm \u0097  the committee approved it. \"It has built-in safeguards and protection for poorer regions,\" he insists.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"New irrigation projects must first come in such places. The Governor's directives on these aspects must be observed.\" And, he points out, \"we put in the `principle of equity' into the law.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Those who can pay must do so. There are farmers in some regions who can pay.\" But he concedes that the rates charged will be the same across the State. Which means many who cannot now afford irrigation, will likely never be able to. Mr. Deshmukh's district has less than four per cent irrigation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Talegaon village, Ramesh Ingole used to pay Rs.400 as water charges for his two acres. \"Then it went up to Rs.590. For the most recent crop we don't even know how much or how we will pay. If this new law is imposed, we are finished.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Bill says that charges \"shall reflect the full recovery of the cost of the irrigation management, administration, operation and maintenance of the water resources project.\" Besides, the Government also seeks \"partial recovery of capital investment.\" (The latter clause appeared in the version of the Bill passed by the Council.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat would this mean in practice? \"If this is the framework, irrigation could cost as much as Rs.8,000 per acre, or more,\" says Prof. H.N. Desarda, a leading economist based in Aurangabad. Prof. Desarda, a former State planning board member, is also an expert on water issues. \"There is no crop in Maharashtra,\" he points out, \"which can sustain such levels of payment.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nBill favours rich?\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"It means non-irrigated farmers will remain that way for life. Or be forced to quit farming in lakhs,\" says Anil Tiwari. He is President of the Pandarkauda Municipal Council in Yavatmal. A district with less than eight per cent irrigation. \"This simply hands over agriculture to the rich.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe poor are not ready to quit, though. \"People won't allow this law to function,\" says Hidayat Khan, a gram panchayat member in Talegaon. In Borgaon, Vijay Kophe is defiant. \"Let them send their tax collector. He will be one person. We will be 1500 to resist him.\" </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

Talk of luck. Not only were we ruled by White Gentleman, the <i>Times</i> pointed out, we were ruled by White English Gentlemen. (It could have been the Dutch, you know.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo committed were these Gentlemen to the governance of this heathen land, they \"would do the utmost to protect our independence... \" And this was not \"superhuman or romantic.' After all, our rulers merely \"act[ed] like English gentlemen of good common sense.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor the enslaved to choose between colonialisms is for the chicken to choose the sauce it prefers to be cooked in. Yet, some still cling to the notion that British colonialism was more benign than others. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis week we mark our escape from good English common sense. As smart a time as any to review its legacy. When the <i>Times</i> (then called the <i>Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce</i>) ran that edit in 1841, it was, after all, owned by other White English gents. When brown Indian gentlemen echo those views 164 years later, it is worth revisiting. When the Prime Minister does not \"entirely reject\" British claims to good governance, it becomes pressing. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat governance was certainly good for the British. Tax collections rose even as millions died of man-made famines. Like Bengal of 1770-72. The East India Company's own report put it simply. The famine in that province \"exceeds all description.\" Close to ten million people had died, as Rajni Palme-Dutt pointed out in his remarkable book, <i>India Today</i>. The Company noted that more than a third of the populace had perished in the province of Purnea. \"And in other parts the misery is equal.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet, Warren Hastings wrote to the directors of the East India Company in 1772: \"Notwithstanding the loss of at least one-third of the inhabitants of this province, and the consequent decrease in cultivation, the net collections of the year 1771 exceeded even those of [pre-famine] 1768.\" Hastings was clear on why and how this was achieved. It was \"owing to [tax collection] being violently kept up to its former standard.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Company itself, as Palme Dutt observed, was smug about this. It noted that despite \"the severity of the late famine and the great reduction of people thereby, some increase has been made\" in the collections. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBetween 24 million and 29 million Indians, maybe more, died in famines in the era of British good governance. Many of these famines were policy-driven. Millions died of callous and wilful neglect. The victims of Malthusian rulers. Over 6 million humans perished in just 1876 \u0097  when Madras was a hell. Many others had their lives shortened by ruthless exploitation and plunder. Well before the Great Bengal Famine, the report of that province's Director for Health for 1927-28 made grisly reading. It noted that \"the present peasantry of Bengal are in a very large proportion taking to a dietary on which even rats could not live for more than five weeks.\" By 1931, life expectancy in India was sharply down. It was now 23.2 and 22.8 years for men and women. Less than half that of those living in England and Wales. (Palme-Dutt.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMike Davis' stunning book, <i>Late Victorian Holocausts</i>, also ought to be required reading in every Indian school. Davis gives us a scathing account, for instance, of the Viceroy Lord Lytton. Lytton was the most ardent free-marketeer of his time \u0097  and Queen Victoria's favourite poet. He \"vehemently opposed efforts ...  to stockpile grain or otherwise interfere with market forces. All through the autumn of 1876, while the kharif crop was withering in the fields of southern India, Lytton had been absorbed in organising the immense Imperial Assemblage in Delhi to proclaim Victoria Empress of India.\" The weeklong feast for 68,000 guests, points out Davis, was an orgy of excess. It proved to be \"the most colossal and expensive meal in world history.\" Through the same week as this spectacular durbar, \"100,000 of the Queen Empress' subjects starved to death in Madras and Mysore\" alone.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn fact, barring the scale, it all sounds depressingly like the present. In terms of ideology and principle at least. The Raj nostalgia of today's neo-liberals is quite heart-felt. Thousands of farmers have killed themselves as the agrarian crisis deepens. Tens of millions have seen their livelihoods destroyed. They now hotfoot it to the cities in hope of succour. Massive amounts of grain were exported during the National Democratic Alliance rule. Even as grain per Indian in 2002-03 fell to the levels of the great Bengal famine. And with all the misery in the countryside, the elite orgy of excess goes on. Lytton would have approved.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn his time, Lytton ordered that \"there is to be no interference of any kind on the part of government with the object of reducing the price of food.\" Leave alone the <i>Times of India</i> of 1841. Lytton could surely land the editorship of most Indian daily newspapers in 2005. Imagine the edits his \"sensitive and poetical mind\" might have thrown up on the idea of guaranteeing employment. Lytton's era saw huge amounts of grain exported to Europe from here while millions of Indians starved to death. Even as he scorned the Indian populace for its \"tendency to increase more rapidly than the food it raises from its soil.\" (Davis: <i>Late Victorian Holocausts</i>.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe neo-liberals of the present have not achieved the scale of death their White English forbearers excelled at. This is surely due to hundreds of millions of brown Indian men and women of good common sense. Blessed with an unpleasant habit of voting now and then. (And, oh yes, the Brits set up roadblocks to stop the rural hungry from pouring into Bombay and Poona. Police threw out tens of thousands of famine refugees. Sounds familiar? How well it sits with the brutal crackdown on slum dwellers in Mumbai.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's a good thing the great uprising of 1857 might be back for a bit on the agenda thanks to a Bollywood film. But it's also worth recalling that the then elites of cities like Bombay held meetings to pray for the success of the British troops. Not for Mangal Pandey and his comrades. Their descendents now plan on how to rid Mumbai of the poor. And would be happy to send Indian troops (mostly from poor rural families) to fight alongside the White English Gentlemen now floundering in Iraq.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCannon fodder\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYes, there's that, too. British good governance killed more than those tens of millions in famines. Countless numbers of Indians died in wars waged for, by, and against the British. Over 8,000 died in the single battle around Kut in Iraq in 1916. London used them as canon fodder in its desperate search for a success against the Turks after the rout at Gallipoli. When there were no Indians around, the British sacrificed other captive peoples. \"Waste the Irish\" was the term used by an English officer when sending out troops on a suicidal mission. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn his book <i>Global Capitalism and India</i>, C.T. Kurien gives us a stark example of British-led globalisation from the 1860s. The civil war in America had hurt the flow of cheap, slave-labour cotton to Britain. So the Raj forced the growing of that crop here on a much larger scale than before. \"From then on, commercialisation of agriculture continued to gain momentum. Between the last decade of the 19th century and the middle of the twentieth, when food production in India declined by 7 per cent, that of commercial crops increased by 85 per cent. Widespread and regular famines became a recurring feature during this period.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe collapse of the purchasing power of the poor was a big feature of British rule. (Sounds a bit like the present?) The policies, bungling, neglect and corruption of Good White English Gentlemen had much to do with the death of perhaps 4 million people in the Great Bengal Famine of 1942-43. As Amartya Sen points out, this appalling event was never officially declared as a famine. It was only in October 1943, when much of the damage had been done, that the famine was \"acknowledged officially in Parliament by the Secretary of State for India... \" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>The Statesman</i> of Calcutta, notes Prof. Sen, raised the issue after the government coyly confessed to the great disaster. The paper wondered why there was \"no direct admission of grave misjudgement on the higher authorities' part.\" How did this square, the paper sought to know, with earlier claims \"that there existed virtually no food problems in India.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAgain, while the scale is wholly different, the parallels are odd. In June this year, we could see Montek Singh Ahluwalia speaking solemnly of problems, even a crisis in agriculture. (Gee! I wonder who told him.) These headaches, he feels, go to back to the mid-1990s. No mention of who was shaping the ghoulish policies of that \u0097  and the present \u0097  period. And no questions asked about it in the media. There's good governance for you. Welcome back, Lytton. All is forgiven, come home. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

A little away from us is a patch that clocks in at minus 13 degrees. This is \"India's first Snowdome\" \u0097  in burning Vidharbha. Keeping its ice rink firm costs Rs.4,000 a day in electricity charges alone.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWelcome to the Fun &amp; Food Village Water &amp; Amusement Park in Bazargaon gram panchayat of Nagpur (Rural) district. A portrait of Mahatma Gandhi greets visitors in the office of the huge complex. And you're assured daily disco, ice skating, ice sliding and \"a well stocked bar with cocktails.\" The 40-acre park itself offers 18 kinds of water slides and games. Also services for events ranging from conferences to kitty parties.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe village of Bazargaon (population 3,000) itself faces a huge water crisis. \"Having to make many daily trips for water, women walk up to 15 km in a day to fetch it,\" says sarpanch Yamunabai Uikey. \"This whole village has just one sarkari well. Sometimes, we have got water once in four or five days. Sometimes, once in ten days.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBazargaon falls in a region declared as scarcity-hit in 2004. It had never faced that fate before. The village also had its share of six-hour \u0097  and worse \u0097  power cuts till about May. These hit every aspect of daily life, including health, and devastated children appearing for exams. The summer heat, touching 47, made things worse.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAll these iron laws of rural life do not apply within Fun &amp; Food Village. This private oasis has more water than Bazargaon can dream of. And never a moment's break in power supply. \"We pay on average,\" says Jasjeet Singh, General Manager of the Park, \"about Rs.4 lakhs a month in electricity bills.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Park's monthly power bill alone almost equals the yearly revenue of Yamunabhai's gram panchayat. Ironically, the village's power crisis eased slightly because of the Park. Both share the same sub-station. The park's peak period begins with May. And so things have been a little better since then. The Park's contribution to the gram panchayat's revenue is Rs.50,000 a year. About half what Fun &amp; Food Village collects at the gate in a day from its 700 daily visitors. Barely a dozen of the Park's 110 workers are locals from Bazargaon.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWater-starved Vidharbha has a growing number of such water parks and amusement centres. In Shegaon, Buldhana, a religious trust runs a giant \"Meditation Centre and Entertainment Park.\" Efforts to maintain a 30-acre `artificial lake' within it ran dry this summer. But not before untold amounts of water were wasted in the attempt. Here the entry tickets are called \"donations.\" In Yavatmal, a private company runs a public lake as a tourist joint. Amravati has two or more such spots (dry just now). And there are others in and around Nagpur.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis, in a region where villages have sometimes got water once in 15 days. And where an ongoing farm crisis has seen the largest numbers of farmers' suicides in Maharashtra. \"No major project for either drinking water or irrigation has been completed in Vidharbha in decades,\" says Nagpur-based journalist Jaideep Hardikar. He has covered the region for years.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Singh insists the Fun &amp; Food Village conserves water. \"We use sophisticated filter plants to reuse the same water.\" But evaporation levels are very high in this heat. And water is not just used for sports. All the parks use massive amounts of it for maintaining their gardens, on sanitation and for their clientele.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"It is a huge waste of water and money,\" says Vinayak Gaikwad in Buldhana. He is a farmer and a Kisan Sabha leader in the district. That in the process, public resources are so often used to boost private profit, angers Mr. Gaikwad. \"They should instead be meeting people's basic water needs.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBack in Bazargaon, sarpanch Yamunabai Uikey isn't impressed either. Not by the Fun &amp; Food Village. Nor by other industries that have taken a lot but given very little. \"What is there in all this for us,\" she wants to know. To get a standard government water project for her village, the panchayat has to bear 10 per cent of its cost. That's around Rs.4.5 lakh. \"How can we afford the Rs.45,000? What is our condition?\" So it's simply been handed over to a contractor. This could see the project built. But it will mean more costs in the long run and less control for a village of so many poor and landless people.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the Park, Gandhi's portrait still smiles out of the office as we leave. Seemingly at the `Snowdome' across the parking lot. An odd fate for the man who said: \"Live simply, that others might simply live.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

Only there is more than one bullet aimed at the player. Vidharbha's farmers are involved in a deadly gamble that concerns the monsoon but goes far beyond it. No one is sowing till the last minute. Those who have purchased seed are holding back. Many are yet to buy their inputs for the season. Some have not even decided on what they will sow. As Vijay Jawandia, a farmers' leader in Wardha, puts it: \"Most do not know till the day before whether they are cotton growers or soybean farmers.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe immediate gamble is on the rains. \"Last year's pre-monsoon showers caused a lot of confusion,\" says Yavatmal Collector Harshdeep Kamble. \"So they are being extra cautious this time. I am really worried about how the rains will work out.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany farmers in 2004 sowed not once but three times in this region. Like Namdeo Bonde in Kothuda village. \"He sowed three times, you might even say four,\" says his brother Pandurang. But the showers only misled him. \"He got a little bit with the third sowing. But the costs were killing. By his third try, input dealers were charging 50 per cent to 80 per cent more. And then his crop failed.\" Sunk in debt, Bonde took his life last November.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"No one has sown a seed so far in this village of Durga-Vaidya,\" says Vinayak Gaikwad, a farmer in Buldhana. Gaikwad, a kisan sabha leader, says: \"Even when the rains come, people might wait a bit longer to make sure.\" That is Gamble 2.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"Equally,\" says D.B. Naik farm activist in Bham in Yavatmal \"if you buy and sow after the first showers and the rains stop, you're finished.\" That is what drove Laxman Wankhede of Ejani village to suicide last October.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGamble 3: \"Acting late gives you some flexibility,\" says Gaikwad. \"You can decide at the last moment what you will sow. If the rains are bad, you choose what needs less water.\" With three failed sowings himself last year, he should know. \"Also, by waiting you can switch from `late' to `early' varieties of seed.\" `Late' varieties yield more but take much longer, up to six months. `Early' types yield less but are out in under five months. When the rains are late, farmers switch to the `early' type.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nLoan burden\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGamble 4: \"Buying inputs too early means your loan burden is higher,\" says Ramesh Deshmukh in Talegaon village, Yavatmal. \"What if the rains come in July? A farmer buying inputs in May pays interest for two extra months.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis is a big problem where perhaps 90 per cent of crop loans are from moneylenders. Their interest rates vary from 60 per cent to 120 per cent per annum. Deshmukh's brother Suresh ended his life last year, crushed by his debt burden. This `flexibility', as many point out, can be a forced one. \"I have no money to buy the inputs,\" says Ranjana, widow of Suresh Deshmukh. \"Who will offer us loans now?\" Given her husband's fate, lenders see the family as a high-risk client. \"Also,\" says Ramesh, \"dealers first attend to cash-paying clients. Those needing credit come much later.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGamble 5: Those who have bought seeds are betting heavily on BT cotton. K.R. Zanzad, quality control inspector at the Agricultural Office, Yavatmal, says: \"Last year, 7,000 bags of BT cotton varieties sold in this district. This year \u0097  so far \u0097  one lakh.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt around Rs.1,600-Rs.1,800 a bag of 450 grams, BT cotton costs three times or more what non-BT cotton does. This raises cost per acre massively.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n In Andhra Pradesh next door, BT cotton results have been disastrous. And approval has been cancelled for some varieties. Yet Vidharbha could see 70 per cent or more of farmers opting for BT in despair-driven hope. The risks are enormous.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGamble 6: Buying inputs late could jack up prices as everyone scrambles for seeds and fertilizer at the last moment. Unless, of course, the monsoon fails and there is no demand. Just now, it seems prices will go up. There will also be a last minute rush for labour as all seek it at the same time. Many small farmers work on the fields of others as well.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n But with a late start, all will be tied down to their own plots. That means a rise in cost of labour \u0097  and not getting it when you need it.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMoreover, the last minute rush for crop loans will push up already high interest rates. So while holding back saves a month of interest, last minute credit comes at higher rates. The banks play no role at all in this. Gamble 7: Striking late deals could well force the farmer to sell his crop to the input dealer at way below the minimum support price (MSP).\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Last year, suicide victim Suresh Deshmukh sold his cotton at Rs.1,600 a quintal. The MSP for his type was Rs. 2,300.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGamble 8: \"If it rains well today, the farmer just has to buy seeds,\" says Sanjay Bhagat in Mahagaon tehsil, Yavatmal. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBhagat, a veteran journalist, is also a director on the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) here. \"Those pushing an artificial shortage can then sell at any price.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n This means many could end up buying spurious seeds. A fast emerging problem in the region. Fake seeds have been linked to several farm suicides across the country.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGamble 9: Late sowing could also expose the crop to higher risks of disease and pest attack. That again feeds into higher costs.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nThe great gamble\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The great gamble is farming itself,\" says Vijay Jawandia. \"This is what policy has done to the farmer. Be it on credit or support price.\" Some are cracking under the tension. Like young Abhay Shamrao Chavan in Mulawa village, Yavatmal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"The rains were just the last straw,\" says his brother Vasantrao. \"He was in real despair about credit. Yet if it had rained on June 12, he would have been here to tell you about it himself.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>

All these must apply.\" In short, if you must kill yourself, make sure you adhere to the <i>pro forma</i>.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMalwagad's graveyard humour aside, the implications are scary. Vidharbha has seen more debt-driven farmers' suicides than any other region in Maharashtra. This, despite the counting process being suspect and often simply wrong. \"Our methods,\" admits one senior official, \"work from the point of view of assessing compensation. That's all. Not to learn why the suicides happen.\" Which means under-counting is built into the process. Governments do not like paying out compensation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nFlawed figures\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo a lot of suicides are not recorded as being debt-driven. Yet, even the flawed numbers are startling. In Yavatmal district alone, farmers' suicides went up from 17 in 2001 to 132 last year. An almost eight-fold increase in four years. Most occur between July and November. But there have already been 29 till May this year. This means there have been more suicides in the off-season this year than in all of 2001.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat numbers would a more honest process show? Sadly, even sensitive officers \u0097  and Yavatmal has a few \u0097  are trapped by the format. So while the ongoing agrarian crisis has spurred several hundreds of suicides across Vidharbha in a short span of time, we will never know their full extent. The counting process stands too corrupted.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAdivasi farmer Digambar Agose (debt: Rs. 70,000) killed himself this January in Yavatmal. His family got no compensation. Agose's suicide \"did not meet the norms\" set up by the Government to determine which is a \"farmer's suicide\" and which is not. The norms are baffling. Most local officials cannot say what they are. And the final judgment is often subjective.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt is the same in Buldhana district. \"We had 84 farmers' suicides here in the last year,\" says journalist Narendra Lanjewar. \"Just 14 of these have been compensated.\" That is one in six. Also, only those 14 will be counted as \"farmers' suicides.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA survey by  <i>The Hindu</i>  of 10 suicide-hit households in three districts found major discrepancies. Families with more than twice the landholding of Agose \u0097  and fewer members \u0097  received compensation. The Agose household, sunk in misery, did not. In some cases, caste played a role. In others, elections. Polls were around the corner when some farmers died but were over when others did. Those affected before voting day were more likely to get help.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut other factors worked, too. At the top, says Yavatmal Collector  Harshdeep Kamble, \"we want to know: was the victim a farmer? Are there loans against his name? Did the banks issue him notices? What is the general condition of the family?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nValid concerns. But the problems are many. The Government only takes note of bank and cooperative loans, though the vast majority get their credit from moneylenders. So very large numbers get excluded in the counting. The Government knows this. \"First the banks give the farmers no loans,\" says an official. \"And then their suicides are not counted because they have no bank loans. It was lack of bank credit that sent them to moneylenders in the first place.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\n`Who is a farmer?'\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNext: who is a `farmer?' In every case, the suicide was that of the main breadwinner. But the land may not have been in his or her name. \"My son ran the farm,\" says Sriram Jharekar in Isoli village, Buldhana, \"I am 80 years old. However, the land is still in my name.\" So when his son Ganesh took his own life this January, there was no question of compensation. Ganesh, by the \"norms,\" was not a farmer. He did not own land. Never mind that he was the only working farmer in the household. His infirm parents can do no work. But are \"farmers.\" That is why when Prabhakar Katale took his life in Wardha, his aged father Shamrao settled his land on his remaining sons at once. Likewise, suicides by women farmers won't be counted. There is no land in their names.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe official inquiry checklist has some 43 indicators. Of these a few are routine. Name, age, sex, caste, address and the like. But there are over 35 others that also have to be gone through. When a suicide takes place, the local Talati reports it to the Tehsildar and assists him inquire into it. The latter reports to the sub-divisional magistrate. The SDM in turn reports to the Collector. In practice, subjectivity rules.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"They can decide this man died of `ill-health' or was a drunkard, or anything,\" says D.B. Naik in Bham village, Yavatmal. \"Anything but debt.\" Naik, a kisan sabha leader here, mocks the process: \"They want a signed statement from the victim that debt and [the] Government drove him to suicide.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA local official might also rule out aid to a family not \"below the poverty line.\" The BPL process itself is bizarre. Digambar Agose's family lives in utter poverty. But it has no BPL card. As we leave the Agose home in Malwagad, we meet the new \"Man of the House.\" Madhav Agose is 12 years old and in the eyes of his village \"responsible for the entire household.\" Madhav works from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day tending livestock. For Rs. 20 a day. Digambar's debts have to be paid. \"And they got nothing as compensation,\" say the neighbours, \"not even free seed in his father's name.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the Pandher Kavada office of the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti, another name is about to enter the \"Register of Deaths.\" Abhay Shamrao Chavan, June 16, 2005. Independent groups, rejecting government figures, are tracking the tragedy. They know there will be many more. Ritesh Parchake, a leading journalist here who has reported the suicides for years, looks on sadly. \"This is the season,\" he says wearily. \"It's only just begun.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005062504361100.htm&amp;date=2005/06/25/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2005/06/25/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p><p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/classads/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/jobs/index.htm\">Employment</a> | \r\n<a href=\"16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p></font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/classads/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/jobs/index.htm\">Employment</a> | \r\n<a href=\"16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n<br></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2005062501621000.htm\">Sri Lanka and post-tsunami structure</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005062501611000.htm\">Saying 'no' to nominations</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005062501601000.htm\">Reforming and strengthening the United Nations</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005062504361100.htm\">Vidharbha: whose suicide is it, anyway?</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005062504351100.htm\">Healing wounds through farm research</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005062501591000.htm\">Back in form</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005062501591001.htm\">RSS &amp;

He was juggling multiple debts at the time. His seven-member household had cut back sharply on its diet. \"It's the same with so many farmers,\" says his wife Rekha. \"We're at the point where if we take our household wheat to the mill, we leave it there till we can pay the miller the tiny amount it takes to grind the flour.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt also meant that Ganesh had no chance of raising the money to get his daughter Sushma, 23, married. The three and a half acres he looked after for his family in Dahihanda village of Akola district yielded little. The agrarian crisis gripping Vidharbha ensured that. Official data suggest that by 2003 around 55 per cent of farm households in Maharashtra were in debt. Perhaps double the number of a decade ago. Things are a lot worse in Vidharbha, where less than 10 per cent of loans are from banks. The rest are from the <i>sahucars</i> or moneylenders. Or from input dealers who are the \"new <i>sahucars</i>.\" These kinds of loans have swelled in the last two or three years.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The interest rate here is Rs.5 per Rs.100 per month,\" says Gajanand Pandurang, a Home Guard. That's 60 per cent. \"And that is if you have something to mortgage. Otherwise it is 120 per cent yearly.\" No one in his village of Dahihanda knows how much Ganesh borrowed from private lenders. But they do know he played <i>bhishi</i>.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>Bhishi</i> (which translates roughly as chit fund) is an activity countless farmers get into. Often at disastrous cost. The system operates under different names in many parts of the country. It is very visible for instance in neighbouring Telangana. How does it work? Each of 10 or more players contributes a recurring sum to a common pool. Say Rs.1,000 a month. This means a collection of Rs.10,000 a month or Rs.1 lakh in 10 months. Each player hopes to hit the monthly jackpot. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhy get into it? There are several push factors. Here, many land in debt even after a successful crop. \"Firstly, after years of failure, people cannot repay their bank loans in full,\" points out Gajanand Pandurang, a Home Guard in Dahihanda. \"If the crop succeeds and you take it to the Cotton Federation, they cut your bank dues. [Which they should not since they are a body to help farmers, not an arm of the banks.] Once that happens you cannot buy your basic needs. So we go instead, as Ganesh did, to the <i>sahucars</i>.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis meant selling the crop at way below the minimum support price to be had at the Cotton Federation. Ganesh sold cotton at Rs.1,500 a quintal when the support price was Rs.2,500. \"Nor will banks give you any new loans,\" points out Pandurang. In that crunch, the <i>bhishi</i> is seen as a possible source of money.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOne form of <i>bhishi</i> is to hold a `lottery' each month for the Rs.10,000 collected. Each member drops a numbered chit into a box and the holder of the chit drawn from it takes the booty. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe more common practice here is the `auction.' Two or three of the members get desperate to have some money. They `bid' for the Rs.10,000. But the bidding is in reverse \u0097  the money goes to the one who bids the lowest. So the man bidding Rs.6,000 is saying he is willing to lose Rs.4,000. That sum he loses is divided amongst the remaining players. Yet he will have to still pay his Rs.1,000 a month to the pool for the term of its existence. Usually 10 months if there are 10 players.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGanesh Thakre was desperate. He had already borrowed money to meet growing health expenses. Rekha's eye operation had cost Rs.12,000. Sushma's bout of typhoid had set them back by Rs.10,000. He had also lost Rs.25,000 on son Sunil's education when the boy had to drop out of college.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt appears very likely that Thakre ended up borrowing money to play <i>bhishi</i>. In the rather impossible hope that hitting the jackpot would solve his problems. <i>Bhishi</i> is not meant to work for poor farmers in debt.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe better off ones who don't need to borrow from the pool profit from this system. In theory, anyway. They keep up with their payments and get back their full amount when the <i>bhishi</i> is closed. And they get some amount each month from the sums forfeited by bidders.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nThe debt trap\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn practice, small farmers slide down a debt trap. They cannot keep up with the monthly payments. So they might lose their principal and continue to owe money. Or they make disastrously low bids (sometimes as low Rs.4,000. Which means they straightaway lose Rs.6,000 or 60 per cent of the amount they are borrowing. Thirdly, they can be forced to make low bids by insincere players who do not need to borrow the sum. They only make bids to force the desperate one to go lower (which increases the profits of the others).\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLastly the fund manager is very often a crook. Thakre was a member of four <i>bhishis</i> at the same time and was gypped in all of them. \"He lost Rs.40,000 in these <i>bhishis</i>,\" says his nephew Sanjay. It also seems likely that he ploughed into <i>bhishi</i> some of the money he took from the <i>sahucars</i>.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGanesh Thakre lost his money. Surely one factor in his suicide this June. His two young sons run a tiny vegetable stall that could fold at any time.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Sushma remains unmarried. And wife Rekha hasn't a clue as to what she can do next. \"The officials did come after his suicide,\" she says. They promised government help. None has arrived. Not a paisa in compensation for the family though the suicide is admitted as having been debt-driven.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor farmers here, waiting for government help is a lot like playing <i>bhishi</i>. Only worse.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

And that's to cater to just 7,000 people.\" Bhagat is a Director of the local Agriculture Produce Market Committee. He is also a long-time journalist of the region. \"Right now, the pressure on people to buy is awful. You can sell them anything.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe coming of the rains set off a desperate scramble for inputs over the weekend. \"In Yavatmal district as a whole,\" says B.M. Orke, \"there are about 1,200 krishi kendras. You might say the total has doubled over a ten-year period.\" Orke is the district superintending agricultural officer.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTo monitor this vast, chaotic network of shops, there is just one full-time quality control inspector. \"You can sell seed anywhere,\" says K.R. Zanzad. \"Seed has no boundaries.\" Quite true. Many brands have sprouted legs and raced across the Andhra Pradesh border. After a crackdown on them in that State, shady sellers have shifted large stocks of fake inputs into Vidharbha.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome of the very brands reported by this newspaper as ripping people off in Andhra Pradesh have found their way here. Our reports (The seeds of suicide: July 20 and 21, 2004) showed packets of seed with the words \"Germination Rate  -   65 per cent\" printed on them. The same packets can be found here with a change. The words 65 per cent have been blacked out. Beside them is a new figure  -   75 per cent. The contents may not have changed, but the numbers on the packet have. Some packets give no rate at all.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We have noticed that,\" says Zanzad. \"We have demanded lab reports and statements to see how this was done. If we find something wrong, we will file cases against them.\" However, by the time that happens, the purchase of inputs would long be over.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nProblem of fake seed\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarmers face problems with both real and fake seed dealers. The bogus ones flood the market. The others charge absurd rates. Some BT varieties come with a 70 per cent royalty tagged on to them. And all prices have shot up in the past decade. Sometimes, the high price of seed pushes farmers towards less costly brands which might be fakes.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The headache with spurious seed is that you figure it out only a month or two after sowing,\" says Sanjay Bhagat. The racket has reached worrying proportions. \"We have lodged FIRs in some cases,\" says District Collector Harshdeep Kamble. \"We find now that they are not stocking these in the shops.\" Bhagat confirms that in Mahagaon. \"The action is now away from the shop.\" Though that's where the dealers trawl for clients. Large sellers feed the smaller shops. \"The sub-dealers have no idea where the big ones get their stocks from,\" says Bhagat. The number of brands, names and claims is bewildering. Since both real and fake stuff are on offer, chaos rules. For those deep in debt and wrecked by crop loss, fake inputs are a nightmare. \"Nothing is regulated anymore There is no control in the seed market,\" farmers in Waifad, Wardha told us at a meeting. In an era when input prices have soared, fake items introduce a risk that can be fatal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNamdeo Patil Bonde in Yavatmal suffered three crop failures before he took his own life last November. \"The input costs crushed him,\" says his brother Pandurang. And don't go by the bills. \"As prices go up, the bills go out. The bill for the BT seeds says Rs. 1,800. What he paid was Rs. 2,200.\" He scoffs at all germination rate claims. \"In my experience, most do not exceed 50-60 per cent.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe profusion of shops does not make inputs cheaper. \"The government pays less for cotton,\" says Manoj Chandurvarkar in Waifad. \"But, seed prices keep going up. As do those of all other items.\" In 1991, he points out, \"seed for an acre cost me Rs. 70-75. Now it costs Rs. 1,000. If we use BT seeds, that cost is Rs. 3,200 or more.\" Farmers also scoff at the government raids. \"They're doing that more for Monsanto than for us. Where are the raids on the non-BT fakes?\" The four raids in Yavatmal have all been on dealers in illegal BT cotton.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, sellers have made a killing. It makes sense to open an inputs store here. The rule now is that a person with a diploma in agriculture can open one. \"Earlier, anybody could,\" says B.M. Orke. \"A law was brought in to ensure only graduates in that field could. But that has been challenged in court.\" \"Earlier,\" he says, \"90 per cent of the farmers used domestic seeds. That had no cost at all. Now the demand for commercial seed has shot up.\" Yet, it isn't just seed costs that are up. \"Pesticides have seen the largest hikes,\" say the farmers in Waifad. \"We once spent as little as Rs.90 an acre. Now it ranges from Rs. 1,000 to Rs.3,000.\" Fertilizer prices have risen three-fold in the past 10 years. The few who have pumpsets paid a lot more for power. From Rs. 900 a year for a 3-HP set, that rose to Rs. 4,500. Transport and labour costs are up. Loans carry much higher interest rates.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLakhs of farmers face heavy losses. For those shifting from food to cash crops over the past decade, the new costs are crippling. For Shankar Wankhede it all proved too much last week. He took his own life in Mahagaon tehsil on June 20. Fake seeds today add a deadly new element to the process. In Vidharbha, the old Biblical saying stands re-written. Now, for farmers here, it is: as you sow, so shall you weep.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

But the two have simply stopped trying to do anything about it. \"Doctors? Treatment? It's all too costly,\" says Shamrao. The couple in Ashti village, Wardha, have joined tens of millions of others in that decision. Up to 21 per cent of Indians no longer seek medical treatment of any kind for their ailments. (That is up from 11 per cent a decade ago.) They cannot afford it. \"And, if we went to the doctor, how do we buy medicines,\" asks Shamrao.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTheir son Prabhakar Khatale committed suicide last July. Like many others in farming, he was devastated by the ongoing crisis of that sector. \"He ended his life because of his loans,\" says Shamrao. A second son, in deep depression following the tragedy, is in no state to look after his aged parents. He does not appear to be under treatment either.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nBooming private healthcare\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe booming \u0097  unregulated \u0097  private medical sector here gives a whole new meaning to the adage: health is wealth. The decline of whatever public health services there were means that poor people boost the profits of private hospitals and practitioners. Health is the second fastest growing component of rural family debt across the country. (India's per capita health expenditure is one of the lowest in the world. The state spends less than 1 per cent of GDP on health.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Waifad village of the same district, farmer Gopal Vithoba Yadav mortgaged his land to pay health bills. \"Just 40 minutes in hospital cost me Rs.10,000,\" he complains. Many others have paid much more. But Yadav parted with the title deed to his nine acres as he needed cash. Successive bad years on the farm had ensured that. \"I am in possession of the land,\" he clarifies. But \"the title deed is in the hands of the moneylender.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHis neighbour Vishwanath Jade has an eight-member family living off four acres. A spinal operation set him back by Rs.30,000. MRI scans a further Rs.5,000. Add Rs.7,500 for his room at the hospital and Rs.20,000 on medicines. And then a heap of travel costs. Within just a year, Jade had to pay bills of Rs.65,000. The kind of sums many such families deep in distress spend on health is staggering. Namdeo Bonde committed suicide last November unable to cope with the farm crisis. He, too, had large health bills. \"He made three trips to Chandrapur, Yavatmal town and Wani,\" says his brother Pandurang in Kothuda village, Yavatmal. \"In all, he spent around Rs.40,000 on health problems.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn other suicide-hit households we surveyed, too, health costs were a big burden. Rs.25,000-Rs.30,000 was a common enough figure. That in households owning two to four acres. And often in heavy losses, with farming slipping by the season. That is why Shamrao and Anjamma just stopped buying medicines. \"At the government hospital,\" say the farmers in Waifad, \"you get nothing.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOn the other hand, \"if we go to Nagpur,\" says Manoj Chandurvarkar, \"we'd have to pay a fortune. People fear a hospital.\" Nagpur's private hospitals mostly reject the blood test reports or X-rays they take in from Wardha. Even if the reports are sound. The referral racket won't be denied its cut. \"So we have to go through the tests all over again. Everyone gets a cut and is happy.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThese \"CT scans and medicines are for big people. We have no money,\" says Rameshwar Chardi, also a farmer. The uncontrolled private sector can charge any fee it fancies. The under-funded, ill-equipped and crumbling government hospitals seem a poor option to many. \"The treatment was `free,'\" laughs Santosh Isai in Malwagad. \"But it meant little.\" He spent Rs.35,000 on medicines and care for his brother Ashok, a cancer patient. Isai sold three acres in this Yavatmal village to raise the cash. Then they ran out of money.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHis friend Sandeep Kadam went straight to a private hospital. He spent almost Rs. 2 lakh on his father who died of TB. \"That meant selling three acres,\" he says. About a third of the land holding of his large family. Like in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, all this hits the farm community in the midst of a crippling agrarian crisis. Very few are able to attend to major health problems without taking loans for it.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnjamma lies on the floor unwell and too weak to sit up. Shamrao sits on the bed, frail and infirm He is pleased he has cleared his dead son's dues. \"We got rid of that debt so that his soul may rest in peace.\" Their own bodies, though, do not. Ill health has taken its toll. Neither, at their advanced age, can work and earn a living. But health comes at a price. A price they, and countless millions like them cannot pay. In Waifad, they bid us a cheery goodbye. \"If you want to know about health,\" says one, \"look at our farming. Then you'll know. We are all on saline drip, us farmers. Two years from now, we'll be on oxygen.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

Santosh Baltilak's suicide meant the end of the Ganesh festival in the village, which had up to seven Ganesh mandals each year till 2004. This year, there are none. In a State where the Ganesh Utsav is simply the most important occasion, this is astonishing. Yet the trend is visible across the Vidharbha region. Not only has the number of mandals decreased sharply, collections for the event have plummeted.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe farm crisis has hit the Ganesh Utsav badly this year. The once massive festival is a very low-key affair. For many, this is heart-breaking. The <i>utsav</i> is not just a religious affair. It is Vidharbha's central social event. \"But who has the money,\" asks Ranjit Kale, a farmer in Sanglud.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs the agrarian distress deepens, the number of farmers' suicides in Vidharbha is mounting. There have been over 60 since June 2 this year despite decent rains. Yavatmal district alone has seen as many as 22 suicides since June. Across the region, farm suicides moved past the 200 mark in less than nine months in 2005. That is more than one every 36 hours.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven these numbers do not capture the extent of such deaths. The counting process stands too corrupted. (See `Whose suicide is it anyway?' <i>The Hindu</i>, June 25, 2005). Yet even a partial list for a single district is alarming. Officially, there have been 280 farm suicides in Yavatmal since 2001. Of which only 57 were found worthy of compensation. The other families got nothing. Yavatmal may not be the worst. If its numbers look bad, that is in part because the district has been somewhat more truthful. It has recorded the deaths a little more honestly.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, soaring input costs, a severe credit crunch, falling cotton prices and the adverse impact of policy measures take an ever-mounting toll.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe collapse in the purchasing power of farmers finds reflection in the subdued Ganesh festival. Villages such as Sanglud are also mourning the loss of well-loved residents such as Santosh. His father Sahebrao, who owns four acres and had four sons, would rotate his land. Each year, one son would gain control of the four acres. The others worked as labourers till their turn came. This year it was Santosh's turn. The first sowing was destroyed by delayed rains. The second by inputs of suspect quality. \"He sold everything,\" says Ranjit Kale. Even his wife's jewellery. \"From that he raised Rs. 7,000 and went for a third sowing. This time, oilseeds.\" That too, failed. \"Most farmers are in the same state,\" says Kale. \"Hence you see such a dull <i>utsav</i>.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We've spent less than Rs. 2,000 for the whole event this year,\" says Sanjay Thakre in Dahihanda village of the same district. \"In past years, the lighting alone would cost over Rs. 12,000. This year we're using old materials. Old cloth for the decorations. And no lighting. I was president of the Ganesh mandal here five years ago. I can see the difference.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis year, Sanjay is out of it. His brother Ganesh Thakre hanged himself in June. Ganesh, one of five brothers, had been running the family's farm and looking after their parents. He was the only one still in agriculture. Mounting expenses on inputs were one part of his problem. A household plagued by ill health was hit by the rising costs of medical care. Deep in debt, and with many of his gambles failing, Ganesh, named after the very deity that the <i>utsav</i> is held for, killed himself in despair.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Pisgaon village in Yavatmal, Maruti Rasse ran his eight-acre farm against the odds. \"He had two sisters and had to get them married,\" says his uncle Chandrabhan Rasse. For two years in a row, Maruti leased out all eight acres. With a novel twist. To sweeten the deal for the lessee, he threw himself in as the main labourer on those eight acres. \"This way, he got his sisters married,\" says his uncle. Each wedding cost Rs. 1 lakh.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut even with the land back in his control, things didn't work. He took on five acres more on lease to raise his output. But Rasse was in trouble. The Cotton Federation, meant to help farmers, pays them a minimum support price. \"But it pays late and in instalments over months,\" says Chandrabhan. And, as farmers here point out, \"we can't eat in instalments.\" So Rasse, and lakhs like him, sold their cotton to private traders. At well below the support price of Rs. 2,500. This meant a loss of thousands of rupees and further piled on the pressure. On June 26, Rasse ended his life by swallowing pesticide.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor many, even a better crop this season may not help. \"Cotton is the lifeblood of 30 lakh mainly poor farmers in this State,\" says Vijay Jawandia, kisan leader and activist. \"Yet it has an import duty of just ten per cent. Till three years ago, it was only five per cent. So the United States and other countries have dumped over 100 lakh bales of cotton on us between 1996 and 2002. The USA alone has subsidised its production by some four billion dollars. Our farmers produce cotton at far lower cost and have increased output. But they are smashed by these imports.

A diploma in agriculture? Or one in engineering? What skills do you require?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Only one,\" smiles K.K. Milmile. \"You need to know how to count the money that comes in.\" Milmile is one of the biggest input dealers in Yavatmal district. And he worries about the fake inputs plaguing the farm community in this cotton territory. Quite a few suicides are linked to the damage these have done. The ongoing season could see many farms in Maharashtra's Vidharbha region sunk by this problem alone.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Maybe 90,000 packets of legal Bt cotton have sold in Yavatmal this season,\" says Milmile. But here's the catch. \"About 2.5 lakh packets of `illegal' Bt seed have also been sold. What damage will these do? It's scary.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNo less scary, though, is the `legal' Bt cotton seed itself. In Andhra Pradesh approval for three varieties of Bt cotton seeds has been withdrawn following disasters there. Here, bloated claims of performance have sold many packets but ground realities are grim. \"Here,\" says Suresh Bolenwar in Hiwrabarsa, gifting us a bollworm from a plant in his field right in front of us. \"This is `legal' Bt for you. It needs spraying for pests other than the bollworm \u0097  and now for the bollworm itself.\" Major newspapers in Vidharbha have begun reporting more bollworm attacks on Bt cotton in the region.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBolenwar says some farmers have done better with `illegal' Bt cotton . In Wardha, kisan leader and farm activist Vijay Jawandia scoffs at the term `illegal.' He calls it \"non-royalty Bt.\" \"All it means is that Monsanto and other companies won't get Rs.1,250 in royalty on each packet. That is how much they extort from the farmer. Both types of Bt are equally risky, anyway,\" he laughs.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHe has a point. If `legal' Bt cotton could shatter Bolenwar's large holding, `fake' Bt cotton (or `chor Bt' as people here call it) killed small farmer Ramkishan Thakre. The packet of seed that he used bears the brand name \"SUNNY\" on it. It bears no manufacturer's name or address. \"BesT Cotton seeds\" says the packet, emphasising the `B' and `T' in `Best' \u0097  to pass it off as Bt.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis is the \"non-royalty Bt\" mainly from Gujarat. It sells at Rs.850 a packet (against Rs.1,600-plus for `legal' Bt cotton and Rs.450 a packet for hybrid cotton seed). It is sold by \"direct marketing\" in the villages. Often through local creditors enjoying leverage with the farmers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEqual numbers are at risk from `legal' Bt cotton. Many are buying into false claims of yields between 12-18 quintals per acre. \"There is no evidence they will get even seven quintals per acre,\" says Jawandia. \"Very often Bt's own literature shows us how false the advertisements for it are.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBesides, sowing Bt cotton could cost a farmer Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 4,000 more per acre than hybrid cotton would. The seeds are three times costlier. It means far higher spending on irrigation and fertilizer. And, as Bolenwar shows, it still needs spraying. The fiasco in Andhra Pradesh supports his finding. And also trashes Bt's major claim \u0097  which is less spending on pesticide. So the `profit' it brings to the small farmer is highly suspect.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnother major worry is that very few Bt fields show the \"buffer zone\" that is supposed to surround Bt cotton. That is, a border of non-Bt crop. That buffer is meant to ensure the pest takes longer to develop a resistance to Bt cotton.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Its absence could devastate both Bt cotton and next door non-Bt crops, say farmers here. They fear this could see the rise of a \"super pest.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nExplosive issue\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut Bt cotton or not, the larger issue of spurious inputs is explosive. Fake stuff exists in fertilizer and pesticide as it does in seed. And the scale of it is massive. So-called legal producers have been behind some of the fake inputs.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYavatmal has some 1,200 krishi kendras today. That is double the number a decade ago. It has just one quality control inspector for the whole district. Most shop owners have no qualifications for their role. But as Collector Harshdeep Kamble points out, quite reasonably, a diploma-holding input dealer could be as bad as the others. \"If his intent is wrong, there will be damage,\" he says.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n At that level, this is true. The fact, though, is that the scuttling of larger regulatory structures in agriculture has brought immense harm.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Private seed companies,\" points out Jawandia, have been given \"a free hand in the name of research cotton. There are no regulations, no scrutiny. Agricultural universities put out no more than 3-4 varieties in 10 years. Then how do these companies bring twenty varieties to the market in ten years? Because that's where they are doing their testing. On the lives of the farmers. Using them as guinea pigs in experiments that could destroy millions.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith the banks turning down lakhs of farmers seeking crop loans, many turn to their inputs dealer as the new moneylender. Ramkishan Thakre had bought his bogus seed from his creditor. \"I'm ashamed to say that our trade has got so linked with <i>sahucari</i>,\" says Milmille in Yavatmal. This creditor-debtor equation lets the new <i>sahucar</i> do more than extort money from his clients. He can also sell them those inputs he wants them to use.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nToday, lakhs of farmers use large quantities of inputs of very suspect quality \u0097  both legal and illegal. Despair has seen tens of thousands embrace Bt cotton as a magic bullet. Many of these own non-irrigated lands with little acreage to experiment on. So for a lot of them, it is a disaster waiting to happen.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe sale of non-Bt cotton seeds has fallen sharply, says Sunil Pawde, a dealer in Panderkauda. From about 15 lakh packets last year to five lakh this year. This means that both legal and non-royalty Bt cotton account for about a third of all sales. If the giant drama now underway ends in tragedy, the phrase \"Chor Bt\" could well be replaced by \"Bt chor.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p>

The <i>talati</i> is one of the lowest links in the chain of the state. How a petty official like him could \"buy\" over 40 acres of land worth millions of rupees in 24 hours was a mystery.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"He had simply stolen it from farmers in debt,\" Gawande, a former Minister, told us in Akola district. \"Now when you borrow money, you sign a deed saying you have `sold' your land to your creditor. This deed is authenticated at the district deputy registrar's (DDR) office. The off-the-record deal is that when you repay your loan, your creditor tears up the document. In fact, he does not. And you find you have been robbed of your land.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNew deal\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMortgaging your land to tide over the credit crunch is <i>pass\u00e9</i>. Land grab is the new deal for farmers struggling in debt. And deeds of sale are the preferred route to land grab. This process involves a whole range of predators, not just the usual suspects. Sure, the traditional <i>sahucars</i> are there in strength. But so are <i>talatis</i>, panchayat employees, and even school teachers (including one winner of a national award). Debt-driven despair has seen many Vidharbha farmers trapped in such deals.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Somewhere, there is this na\u00efve belief that the creditor will tear up the sheet,\" says Gawande. \"And people like the <i>talati</i> are well suited for this game as he is a fellow with access to the land records.\" But there's worse. \"At least two murders have occurred in this Barshitakli tehsil alone when people have tried getting back their land.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLike Santosh Sontake who lost both his land and his father as a result of this racket. His father Gopal \"mortgaged\" three and a half acres in this fashion in Janunagaon village. \"He borrowed Rs.20,000,\" says Santosh. That from a school teacher who was also a big landowner. \"The land is worth about Rs. 5 lakhs. He bluffed my father into signing that deed and even into staying with him for a while. When I made my father see what was going on, the trouble began.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGopal Sontake was murdered by hired killers. \"And I was arrested,\" laughs Santosh. \"The effort was to frame me for killing my own father.\" However, the case collapsed when one of the hired killers was caught. \"He confessed he had taken Rs. 50,000 for the job.\" But the <i>sahucar</i> is still free. And Santosh still needs to get that deed of sale scrapped. \"I was paying him two and a half times what my father borrowed. He refused it. Why would he accept Rs. 50,000 when the land he's stolen is worth Rs. 5 lakhs?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"In just two or three <i>tehsils</i>, we have verified over 900 acres stolen in this fashion by some 20 <i>sahucars</i>,\" says Gawande. He insists it is only the tip of the iceberg. As the MLA from this region \u0097  from the Shiv Sena \u0097  he has been flooded with petitions from over 200 farmers who have been duped the same way. Even as he spoke to us, more farmers streamed in to complain. \"I have lost three and a half acres,\" says Kailash Wankhede of Savargaon Jire village in Washim district. \"My <i>sahucar</i> has done this to seven others like me.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This kind of land loss is also a factor behind some of the farmers' suicides,\" says Gawande. Like Ram Krishan Tharore who took his life in Paravbhavani village. Tharore even left a note naming the <i>sahucar</i> who had done this to him. But the latter, a panchayat samiti member, is out on bail. The villagers believe he paid the police a Rs.2 lakh bribe to wiggle out.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarm suicides in the troubled Vidharbha region have been mounting. In less than nine months this year, their number has crossed 200. Most of them debt-driven. Farmers have been hit by both skyrocketing input costs and the collapse of formal credit. Those who have seen successive crop failures are the worst off. In no state to repay their bank dues, they cannot get even the most modest crop loans. The Cotton Federation offers them little hope despite a promised support price. \"If we go the Federation,\" say the farmers, \"they cut our bank dues. And they pay us in instalments over a long time. How do we feed our children? In instalments?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nCaught between a rock and a hard place, the farmers turn in despair to private money lenders. This means selling their crop at way below the market rate. With hungry families they are unable to feed, their debt burden sharpens. It also makes them easy prey for a number of exploitative scams. Including this form of land grab.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"My brother was murdered,\" says Meera Jadhav of Janunagoan in Akola. Her father Motiram had borrowed money from the same <i>sahucar</i> as Gopal Sontake. \"He signed away two acres, believing the <i>sahucar</i> was a man of his word. Then when he died, my brother took over.\" The farming crisis was deep and \"he parted with the rest of our land the same way. There was no other means of raising money. Now all our five acres were gone.\" Soon after he began trying to get his land back, her brother was murdered.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nStrong-arm action by Gawande and his supporters saw the return of the land to her control. Now the situation is odd. \"The land is in my possession, but the deed is in the <i>sahucar</i>'s hands,\" she says. \"This whole game feeds off farmers' distress,\" says Gawande. \"Their pathetic state is an invitation to such racketeering.\" He counts 138 acres that have been returned to their owners after his intervention.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHe has also raised the issue in the Maharashtra Assembly and says the Chief Minister did respond. \"Now there will be a committee in every district to whom such cases will go. This includes the Collector, the SP and the deputy registrar. If their enquiry finds there was land grab, the land transfer will be reversed.\" That won't be easy as those in charge of land records at the ground level are themselves into the game in a big way. But it is a start. Just one that comes too late for Gopal Sontake and Motiram Jadhav.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

An agrarian one. Official data given to the National Commission on Farmers (NCF) shows that Yavatmal district alone has seen well over 300 farmers' suicides since 2001. The figures indicate suicides in the district have doubled almost every year in that period. Not that Yavatmal is the worst. It has just been relatively more honest in counting this terrible loss of lives. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet, like everywhere else, these data exclude large numbers of such deaths by using a highly flawed definition of `farmer.' For instance, if the main cultivator of a household kills himself, but the land is in his aged father's name, this is not counted as \"a farmer's suicide.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, unless the government announces a hike in the prices being offered for cotton, the period from November to January could see a huge rise in even these dismal numbers. And Yavatmal is just one of several districts in the region gripped by crisis. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTypically, the Cotton Federation here adds around Rs.500 as advance bonus to the minimum support prices (MSP) offered by the Centre. Thus if the MSP for major varieties was roughly Rs.1700, the price offered to the farmer was Rs.2250. This year, there will be no advance bonus. It has been withdrawn. Which means \u0097  and most farmers do not know this yet \u0097  that Rs.1700 is all they will get. A straight Rs.550 drop. This works out to below the cost of production and would cripple lakhs already mired in debt. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRs.1700 a quintal is a price farmers were last stuck with in 1994 \u0097  eleven years ago. A period in which the cost of every single input has shot up many times over. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We have hundreds taking their lives at the price of Rs.2250,\" says farmers' leader Vijay Jawandia. \"How many suicides there will be at Rs. 1700?\" A team of the NCF, led by Dr. M. S. Swaminathan, toured this region for three days. It has issued an appeal for a higher price for cotton. And for linking MSP \"with the wholesale price index (WPI). As is done in the case of salaries and allowances of government employees.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCatch-22 situation\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe NCF's appeal is vital and urgent. For Vidharbha is in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't trap. A bumper harvest could further depress prices. More so since millions of bales of cotton already lie in stock. With the United States alone subsidising its 25,000 cotton producers to the tune of $ 3.9 billion a year, world prices are already at a low. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOn the other hand, a failed crop would wipe out farmers who have borne their highest input costs ever. Bt cotton area has increased 30 per cent. Which implies even greater input costs. And some of them have sown two, even three times in the same season after being hit by crop failure. With Diwali around the corner and prices tumbling, distress sales will begin soon. Maybe at prices as low as Rs.1,400 a quintal. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the three days the NCF team toured Vidharbha, there were six suicides. In Panderkauda, the body of the latest farmer to take his life entered that town's hospital the same day the team arrived there for a meeting on farmer distress. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe NCF team was deeply moved by its experience and called for urgently needed measures. For instance, the Commission has bluntly stated: \"Without a huge infusion of credit, there is no hope.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome of team's village visits were a revelation. Asked by the State Minister for agriculture, who accompanied the team, why they did not try selling milk, farmers scoffed: \"Milk is selling at Rs.9 a litre while Bisleri goes for Rs.12 a litre. Is that any price? And there's a huge fodder shortage here, anyway.\" That shortage has followed the decline in Vidharbha of jowar \u0097  a source of fodder in this un-irrigated land.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOne suicide-hit household the team visited, that of Maruti Rasse in Pisgaon, got compensation 72 hours before their arrival. The tragedy had occurred months ago. But official help showed up the minute the household appeared on the team's itinerary. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I asked my friend, a banker, for a loan,\" one farmer told the NCF at a public meeting in Waifad village of Wardha district. \"My friend said, sure, but not as a farmer. That way you get nothing. Start some enterprise like a shop selling seeds and I'll give you a loan. I did and I got a loan of Rs.2 lakhs. The shop failed. I am not cut out for business. Now I was in worse trouble. I told my friend I could not repay. He said that was no problem. Pay Rs.25,000 and we'll cover up the rest of it in some other losses. I did what he said and it worked.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"That is the difference between seeking a loan as a farmer and asking for it as someone from commerce or industry.\" The team also listened to farmers who had mortgaged several acres of land to pay their health bills. The collapse of the public health system had placed them at the mercy of predatory private hospitals.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome of the government-organised visits for the team were strongly criticised by leading sections of the Marathi press like <i>Sakaal</i>. A few meetings were not announced at all, or had their venues changed at the last moment. So many who wanted to attend them could not do so. Yet, even these events proved embarrassing. One of them was wound up with alacrity after farmers challenged some tutored speakers as agents and brokers of the Bt seed companies.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe NCF has called for a \"Centre-State Contributory Price Stabilisation Fund.\" For linking MSP to the WPI. For a huge infusion of credit. For the Cotton Federation to pay farmers at one time and not in instalments (Many are yet to get their dues for last year's produce.) They have also called for a hike in import duties on cotton and for checking the dumping of subsidised cotton on the Indian market to prevent distress sales. It has importantly suggested that the price of cotton should reflect \"what the international price would be if these price-distorting subsidies [of the U.S. / EU] were not there.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWithout swift action on these measures, the November-January period could bring Vidharbha its most deadly harvest yet. </p> <p>\r\n</p>

Raibai Gavai cries as she shows us the rubble that was her house. Not only were the houses razed, property was looted or destroyed too. For some, that meant everything they owned. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Dalits here are impoverished agricultural labourers. Some of these tiny, ruined dwellings housed 12 or more people. The over 150 families in the <i>basti</i> have homes bunched together, often joined by common walls. The flames must have spread quickly. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"It was the Pola (worshipping of cattle) festival day,\" says Liladhar Bhatkar. We passed several oxen that week, painted purple-pink for the occasion. \"The Malis brought their cattle to this <i>mandir</i> in a procession. They have never done that before. Some of them, badly drunk, abused us. Then they stormed these houses in a big mob.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"They burned their own homes,\" a huge group of people speaking to us in the Mali <i>basti</i> insists. Dinesh Deokar is a member of the Bhagwan Datta trust, which he claims owns the <i>mandir</i> in the Dalit <i>basti</i>. \"We've been there before but this had never happened. They stoned and attacked us. They even tried to damage the Ambedkar statue in front of the <i>mandir</i> and blame it on us.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA temple in a Buddhist <i>basti</i>? Caste Hindus amongst its trustees? A <i>mandir</i> on Dalit turf that caste Hindus would visit? An Ambedkar statue next to it? Attacks on Dalits in Akola \u0097  a Dalit stronghold? It's as complex as it gets. Belkhed is where a past of deep oppression meets a present full of risk and contradictions.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBelkhed itself has no history of open caste violence. Yet, its balance is a fragile one. The Malis are landowners. The Dalits, landless workers. Wages are dismally low. Male Dalit workers get Rs.30 and the women just Rs.20 a day. With agriculture crashing across the region, the Mali farmers, too, are in decline. That process and its class tensions, too, get reflected in caste animosity towards the workers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe <i>mandir</i> was built by the Dalits when they were still Hindus. That is, before 1956, when they followed Dr. Ambedkar into Buddhism. It, however, stayed on their soil. And this did not matter much. Caste Hindus mostly avoided their <i>basti</i>. Only Hindu Dalits who had not converted would go there. And that was that. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe decades after 1956 saw the rise of a new politics in Vidharbha. More so in Akola. \"This region saw a strong political assertion amongst Dalits,\" says Madhu Jadhav a veteran journalist in Akola. \"Their organised strength posed a challenge to the land-owning Patils of different castes.\" The Dalits of Belkhed, amongst others, shook off the chains of a past of unspeakable misery. They were still very poor. But the worst excesses of landlord cruelty could now be fought off. Untouchability did not vanish. But it was pushed back. There were even a few inter-caste marriages. And some land struggles. These were a confident people. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAkola emerged a strong Dalit political centre. Republican Party of India candidates for this Lok Sabha seat crossed the 40 per cent voting mark in the late 1960s. Some Assembly seats here have often been held by the RPI and even by Prakash Ambedkar after he broke away to form the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangha. Dalits over these decades had found their dignity and a firm voice. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo much so that even non-Dalit parties often ran Dalit candidates in elections. The zilla parishad chairman has been, more than once, a Dalit from the BJP or Shiv Sena. Dalit-led parties too, put up Mali candidates. In short, a pragmatic sharing of political space. This underlay Prakash Ambedkar's move for a grouping across caste lines that included the Malis. It came to be called the \"Akola Pattern\" and even worked for a while. However, while caste tensions were played down, they were far from eliminated.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe past decade saw setbacks. Like much of the country, the region saw an aggressive right-wing Hindu assertion. And a decline of organised Dalit politics as the RPI and others splintered in factional wars. The Akola pattern frayed. Prakash Ambedkar's defeat in the last Lok Sabha poll also mirrored these realities. In this milieu, the remnants of an ugly past have re-surfaced. Add to this the crisis in agriculture and sharpening wage conflicts. There could be other Belkheds as landowners try shifting their problems on to the backs of already poor workers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHouse rebuilding has begun. But Belkhed's Dalits remain vulnerable. \"We can't sleep safely at night,\" says Chandrakala Ingle in the <i>basti</i>. \"What's worse, they are boycotting our labour. This trouble over the <i>mandir</i> is hurtful.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nOther angles\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe fuss over the <i>mandir</i> has other angles, though. The tiny structure sits on 534 square feet of land. And more space adjoins it. All of this is within the Dalit <i>basti</i> and is right on the vital road leading in and out of Belkhed. At least one better-off Mali landlord views that as prime real estate. \"Basically three or four people on either side had a dispute over this land,\" says Superintendent of Police S.D. Waghmere. \"They managed to convert that into a wider conflict.\" The police also arrested 44 persons who are now out on bail.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the Mali <i>basti</i> they complain of police brutality. They show us the doors police broke down to drag out suspects late at night. And women in shock from that raid. \"Some 200 people have fled the village,\" they say. However, when police first entered the <i>basti</i>, they were attacked by the Malis. It was after this that the police cracked down. And policemen, too are in the Akola hospital, lying alongside the injured Dalits and Malis.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome suffered from just being caught in the crossfire. Among the arrested was the village's main shepherd whose tribal family assures us they have no stake at all in the conflict. \"See the result,\" says Suman, wife of Mahadeo Sishir. \"The livestock of the village lay untended for days.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt the end of the day, there is no doubt about who the victims were. The Dalit houses burned down by the Malis write their own evidence. The claim that they did it themselves is a fiction reeking of caste prejudice. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPolice action, not Dalit violence, brought damage to the Mali <i>basti</i>. No Dalit in Belkhed attacked anyone's house or property. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe labour boycott hits the Dalits hardest of all, leaving them hungry for days. Yet, with agriculture crumbling, the Malis, too, are in trouble. Using outside labour raises costs. Wage tensions can only grow. As the old Akola pattern erodes, other political forces fish in troubled waters. No one knows how chapter two in Belkhed will read. But the poor of the village pray for a happy ending.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005092704521100.htm&amp;date=2005/09/27/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2005/09/27/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n</font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../26hdline.htm\">Engagements</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/classads/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/jobs/index.htm\">Employment</a> | \r\n<a href=\"16hdline.htm\">Obituary</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><div class=\"bluebk\">\r\n<li><a href=\"2005092703031000.htm\">The dispiriting parallelism</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005092703021000.htm\">Indian Airlines set  to take off at last</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005092703011000.htm\">The unravelling of India's Persian puzzle</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2005092704521100.htm\">Belkhed: the riots &amp;

A cavalcade of cars cruised into this Wardha village to meet his wife \u0097  but she has lost her sanity. Just like one of her sons did last year. Another son, Prabhakar, committed suicide in 2004. Shamrao's wife is yet to grasp that her husband is dead. She has withdrawn into a private world where none of this has happened. Those who can speak are her daughter Ganga, unmarried at 31 because of the family's bankruptcy during the farm crisis. And yet another son who has returned jobless from Amravati.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nShamrao and his wife, both quite ill, stopped taking medicines for a year. \"Who can afford doctors?\" Shamrao had asked me in June. \"Not us. It's all too costly. And how do we buy medicines?\" <i>(See: Health as someone else's wealth, The Hindu, July 1, 2005.)</i> Not different from 21 per cent of all Indians who have stopped seeking medical aid because they cannot afford it. And Prabhakar who took his own life was not much different from hundreds of farmers who have done the same in crisis-ridden Vidharbha.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut Shamrao's house was special. Quite a few political leaders of some fame had visited in the past year. Among them, Narayan Rane, Pramod Mahajan, Uddhav Thackeray, Gopinath Munde, and Nitin Gadkari. As one of the neighbours asked: \"If all these <i>netas</i> could not save this one man, imagine the fate of the thousands of Vidharbha farmers visited by nobody.\" Oddly, Shamrao's family could be said to have received better treatment than the others.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNo compensation paid\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nUnder the fraudulent rules by which a suicide is deemed to be a \"farmer's suicide,\" no compensation was due to him for Prabhakar's death in 2004. The family's six acres were in Shamrao's name. Which lets the Government say Prabhakar was not a farmer \u0097  where's the land in his name? However, Sonia Gandhi's trip to Vidharbha at that time ensured the family got Rs.1 lakh. Of this, Rs.30,000 came in cash and vanished in debt payments. The rest went into a fixed deposit that gave them less than Rs.450 a month in interest. On this, four persons lived till Shamrao's death last week. Every paisa went for food. Medicines were out of the question.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe news of his death did not put the NCF team members off their visit. They went anyway. For this was a household capturing many facets of the farmers' crisis under one roof. Soaring debt. Farming wrecked by high input costs and low output prices. No access to bank loans. Dependence on money-lenders. An unmarried daughter. Hit by rising prices on all fronts, including health. In short, destroyed by the predatory commercialisation of the countryside.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven as the team drove into Ashti, locals pointed out that there had been three farmers' deaths in the same lane. The <i>Sakaal</i> correspondent here says the total for the block is eight. The surviving son of one of these, Amol Digambar, met NCF chairman M.S. Swaminathan, who led the team to Vidharbha for a three-day fact-finding visit.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe only visit to a suicide-hit household that the Government set up for the team came the next day. The dead farmer had seven acres. And his widow is back in her father's place. Which is where the team met her. Between them, members of her father's family own hundreds of acres. So, of countless affected families in Vidharbha, this was probably chosen because the house seemed in such fine shape. (Yet, as her uncle, a large landowner, told me, \"even for us this is a period of big risk.\")\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBandargaon in Yavatmal gave the team a taste of how poor Adivasi farmers in Vidharbha live. That the first few houses at the village's entrance had been hastily painted that morning for the team's visit made the contrasts starker. The painted houses seemed alien in a miserable village cloaked in near total darkness. Few here have used electricity in a long time. The main source of illumination for the meeting was the bracket light of a video camera with the journalists present. Being the only glow in a large area, it drew swarms of moths and insects that the visitors sat picking out of their faces and shirts.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I can't let my daughters go to school,\" said Yashoda, whose husband Ratilal Rathor committed suicide in August. There is no school going beyond the 4th standard within access. And her very young girls are both working for Rs.20 a day \u0097  when they get work. Together with the Rs.30 Yashoda gets for the same labour, that is the money which keeps the household going. Rathor had killed himself, distraught over crop failure, falling income and rising debt.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe excitement over Bt cotton is pretty much punctured. But the deed is done. For months it was vigorously promoted by Ministers, (hired) film stars, officials, and even sections of the media.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Also, brands banned in Andhra Pradesh are freely available here. So lots of farmers have invested in it at huge cost. The very farmers held up as its success stories are in deep trouble now. For many banking on it, a disaster seems in the offing.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe collapse of rural credit, soaring input costs and falling output prices were themes greeting the NCF team everywhere. \"Don't measure progress in terms of production in tonnes,\" urged Dr. Swaminathan. \"Measure it in the rate of growth of farmers' incomes.\" By which yardstick, much of Vidharbha is a disaster zone.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Nagpur, the NCF team, of Y.C. Nanda, Atul Sinha, and Dr. Swaminathan called for control to be exercised \"over racketeering in trade and distress.\" They also urged the Government to intervene \"far more strongly in this sector.\" They termed the crisis as one calling for urgent measures to ensure the farmers a better price, easier credit and higher income.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nFarm community exhausted\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nVidharbha's farm community stands exhausted. There has been a suicide by a farmer every 12 hours while the team was in the region. There have been many more since they left. The toll has been mounting since June. There were 29 reported since just September 26 and the pace has quickened this month. Diwali is going much the way the Ganesh Utsav did. It has brought little or no celebration to the villages. None at all to the house of Shamrao Khatale.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p>

For decades, it was Narsamma, 50, who kept both farm and family going. Two years later, the Government has taken note of this suicide. And an inquiry process seems to be on. But her family is unsure of any compensation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPedda Narsamma was a Dalit. And a woman. And women are not accepted as \"farmers.\" Which means this may not finally go down as a \"farmer's suicide.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Our mother ran everything,\" says her son, Narasimhalu. \"My father is mentally unsound and has not worked in a long time. She did most of the work at home, brought up the children and even looked after her grand children. She also planned and did much of the work on our five acres. And often worked on the fields of others to make ends meet.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBy 2002, the ends would not meet. And Narsamma planned her own end. \"It was too much for her that the crops kept failing,\" says Narasimhalu.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nJust farmers' wives\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat thousands of farmers have committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh in the past seven years is now known. Far less known is that women farmers, too, have taken their lives in no small number. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt is only in recent months that \u0097  in a few cases \u0097  their suicides are being counted at all. \"In both social and official perception,\" says a senior Government officer, \"the farmer is a landed male with a patta. Women do not fit in that category. Their property rights do not exist in practice. And men do not accept them as farmers. They are seen, at best, as farmers' wives.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThough close to a fifth of all rural households in India are female-headed, few women hold titles to land. Even in land-owning households, they do most of the work on the farm, but are not seen as farmers. In one estimate, women account for 90 per cent of all those engaged in transplantation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n They also make up 76 per cent of those sowing seeds and 82 per cent of people transporting crops from field to home. They are a third of the work force that prepares the land for cultivation. And between 70 and 90 per cent of those involved in dairying.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn districts like Anantapur and Mahbubnagar, the numbers of women-headed households are even higher. Lakhs of people migrate from these regions each year in search of work. With men usually going first. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nWorking against odds\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn recent times landed farmers have joined the same landless labourers they used to employ, in large-scale distress migrations out of the State. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis leaves still more women running farms, families and finances alone and against huge odds. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThose odds proved too much for Kovurru Ramalamma in Digumari village. \"The only thing I ever saw her do was work,\" says Sudhamani, her daughter. \"My father never did. The two acres of land we had leased kept her busy every moment that she was not running the home. She worried about my marriage and that of my sister.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBy 2000, the family's debts touched Rs. 1.5 lakhs as crops failed. Over Rs. 30,000 went in medical costs. A broken Ramalamma, 46, consumed pesticides and took her life. After her death, her family gave up the leased land. They have none of their own. That makes compensation claims sticky. How do they prove they were farmers when it happened?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Khadarpetta village, N. Bhagyalakshmi, 28, couldn't cope any longer. \"She asked me,\" says her husband Jayaram Reddy, \"`When will we pay off all these debts?'\" They owed Rs. 1.6 lakhs. This June, \"when it was clear there would be a fourth bad year, she took her own life.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere have also been suicides among women farmers whose husbands have migrated. Swaroopa Rani, vice-president of the All-India Democratic Women's Association in the State, explains why. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nMany responsibilities\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"To begin with, they were doing the bulk of the work. Now they have to face the banks, the moneylenders. They have to bring up the children and send them to school. Raising and spending money for the needs of the household becomes their job. And, on top of it all, they have to run the farm. Sometimes, the pressure becomes too much.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd sometimes, one suicide swiftly follows another. As in Choutapalli village in Krishna district. \"Madduri Anasuya killed herself three days after her husband Mohan Rao took his own life,\" points out AIDWA's Swaroopa Rani\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHow many women's suicides have there been in these years of farmer distress? \"We may never know, \" says Dr. Rama Devi. Now based in Hyderabad, she was teaching at the Government Medical College, Anantapur, in 2001 when she noticed the number of women's suicides being brought in or reported. \"They too, were certainly victims of the agrarian crisis,\" she says. Moved by the intense misery she was witness to, Dr. Rama Devi brought out a book on the subject in Telugu titled \"Cheyutha\" (Helping Hand). In it, she tried listing the deaths.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"In a single year from August 2001,\" says Dr. Rama, \"there were 311 women's suicides in just Anantapur district alone. And these were only the recorded ones. There must have been a lot more that went unreported. Close to 80 per cent of these 311 were from villages. And most of the women were from a farming background.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The links with the farm disaster were clear and many. For instance, the worse the farm crisis got, the more the dowry problems grew. This was a factor in quite a few suicides. The crisis also had another serious fallout for families. Many weddings were delayed for lack of money. And I came across cases where the girl committed suicide because she felt she was a burden on her family.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nHit in other ways too\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The women were also hit in other ways. As farming floundered, many families came to the towns. The men sought work as auto drivers or daily wage labour. Often without success. In this struggle against poverty, the stress on their wives was enormous. Drunkenness and beatings were on the rise. Some of these women, too, took their own lives. Whichever way you look at it, the collapse of farming in Anantapur was closely linked to the suicides of hundreds of women in the district.\" </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

The creditors arrived the moment we did. They did not describe themselves that way, but hovered around Bhagawantamma. Even trying to answer some of the questions we asked her. Maybe we were Government officials giving her some money. If so, they would take it from her the moment we left. Her husband, Tanki Balappa, committed suicide just days ago. At least a couple of the men present had lent him money. They are also amongst the bigger landowners here in Rakonda village, Mahbubnagar. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBalappa's crops had failed \u0097  on the one-and-a-half acres he owned and on the three he had taken on lease. Bhagawantamma is not clear on how much he had borrowed, as he never consulted her. It could be around Rs. 85,000 or upwards of Rs. 1 lakh. Now she has to look after two sons and a daughter while running the farm. And cope with the creditors. Including some who might have no proof that her husband owed them anything.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSuicides amongst their own numbers are not the only way women farmers are hit by the ongoing crisis. Suicides by their husbands leave many in a predatory world. There is a high risk of losing the family's land. And of facing extreme pressure, including sexual harassment, from creditors and others.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCreditors swoop in\r\n</font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nClaims by moneylenders, real and fake, swiftly follow the husbands' suicide. This was evident in all six districts where we surveyed such households. In many cases, the widows had little or no idea of the extent of their husbands' debts. \"That's men's business,\" as one villager told me sternly.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRight now, it is the woman's business whether she likes it or not, as Yadamma of G. Edavalli village, in Nalgonda district, is finding out. The widow of Korvi Salaiah has just begun to gauge the scale of her husband's borrowings. Each day brings a fresh demand. \"He never told me anything about what he was doing,\" she said. There are many who will be telling her about it soon. And forcefully.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe field is also open for fraud in societies that go largely by trust and the spoken word. More so, when many widows feel responsible for their husbands' dues, even if never consulted by them. For Kamalamma, whose husband Pamul Reddy took his life this year in Mushampalli, Nalgonda, \"the issue is not a legal one. It is my moral duty to clear my husband's debts.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nImambi in Rayalappadhodi, Anantapur, is one woman who does dispute a creditor's claims. It has not stopped him from grabbing five acres of her land, though. Imambi's husband, Razaksaab, committed suicide in March 2003. Local journalists say that the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, met and helped her when on a visit to Anantapur. But Imambi's 15 minutes of fame did not help get back the land. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are other dangers too. Children becoming bonded labourers is one of them. All three sons of Lakshmamma in Munnanuru village, Mahbubnagar, are bonded. \"What choice do we have? Just look at our condition,\" she says. Her husband, Pedda Bhimaiah, a farmer with just one acre, took his life in despair eight months ago. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe fortunes of already indebted families sink faster after the suicide. And sometimes, that causes a second one. In Mirdhoddhi, Medak district, Gunnala Narayana took his life last August after yet another crop failure. This June, less than a year later, his son Kumar did the same, unable to face his creditors. Kumar's wife, mother and sister are in dire straits. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nAssets diminish\r\n</font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWithin months of the suicide, many widows and families are left with no assets whatsoever. And no prospect of acquiring any. Among those left behind by the suicide of Dhomala Srinivas in Suranpalli in Medak are his ailing mother, Lakshmi, his handicapped sister, Satyalakshmi and his father, Narasaiah, who suffers from paralysis. The family had sold all cattle and some land to keep afloat. Their debts and health expenditures mount in tandem.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDrought makes the unbearable impossible. More so, when male members of the household migrate in search of work. A rural woman could spend up to eight hours a day on just three chores: fetching water, firewood and fodder. That is, a third of her life. This is apart from cooking, washing and looking after the children. When drought strikes, she could be walking twice the `normal' distance in search of water. The hunt for fodder becomes more urgent as the condition of livestock begins to deteriorate. The absence of any support at home makes things worse.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Jambuladhine, Anantapur, Lakshmi Devi has lost both husband and sanity. P. Nagireddy was a farmer and a marriage broker hit on both fronts. Crop failure ruined many like him. The crisis also put off countless weddings and thus ruined his marriage broker business as well. The delay in his own daughter's wedding crushed Nagireddy, who committed suicide in April last year. Sick with worry about her debts and her daughters, Lakshmi Devi went out of her mind.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nEducation, a casualty\r\n</font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe farm crisis has also wrecked the education of many girls. In Kurugunta in Anantapur, the bright younger daughter of G. Hanumantha Reddy has had to quit school. Her family cannot afford it. This district has seen some young girls committing suicide after being pulled out of school.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe world the `suicide widows' face is a daunting one. To run the farm, face the creditors, bring up the children and earn a living is not easy. Nor is having to pay off debts they did nothing to incur. Yet, some of them try. Like Parvati who, having studied till the 10th class, is one of the most educated young women in Chinna Mushtiuru, Anantapur. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nParvati counselled her husband, Duggala Mallappa, against despair. She pointed out to him that the whole village was in the same state of debt. And asked him not to give in to the pressures of moneylenders. He did. And Parvati tries today to run the farm while bringing up three young daughters aged 6, 4 and 10 months. The odds are stacked against her. But there is no trace of self-pity in her words. Just a calm determination to see that her girls get some education, like her. \"Somehow,\" as she says, \"we have to pull on.\" </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

Tears fill the old man's eyes each time he tries. So he turns to his grandson Narasimhulu to have him tell us the story. It is not much different from that of hundreds of other farmers who have committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh. With one twist in the tale.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis family's chance of getting any compensation is bleak. No post-mortem examination was done last December when Saianna took his own life in Jengarala in Mahbubnagar district. Which means they cannot now establish suicide as the cause of death. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt was not done because they could not afford it. And there are many such households that did not get post-mortems done. Some, for sentimental reasons. Others, because it costs too much.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn most places, `post-mortem' (Latin for `after death') is taken to mean the autopsy or examination of a body after demise. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat is, to help determine the cause of death. In much of rural Andhra, it means a heap of other things. It is a thriving after-death industry.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nPaying for it\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt means, for instance, \"you have to pay the police, the doctor, the orderly, the man who drives the body to the hospital,\" says G. Shekhar in Jengarala. Seeing us struggle with this, he laughs: \"Surprised? When even getting the simplest signature from an official costs Rs.50, did you think this would come free?\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn theory, yes. There is no charge for a post-mortem. But people do end up paying. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMost of the households hit by suicides that we surveyed across six districts had forked out money for this. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany had spent around Rs.5,000. Several had shelled out much more. Some had ended up losing as much as Rs.10,000 on the process. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"It is illegal. It is also heartless to torment people already in grief and so deep in debt,\" says Dr. M. Geyanand. A medical practitioner in Anantapur, he points out that: \"One in the family has just killed himself because of debt. Then comes this pressure to incur more of it.\" Many of those who paid speak freely of the sums spent on the different actors. But are cagey when it comes to saying what they paid the police. Typically, the man driving the jeep with the body to the post-mortem venue got Rs.2,000. The police took between that and Rs.3,000. The `orderly' or attender got Rs.1,000. And the doctor's charge varied from nothing to Rs.2,000.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"A cost of Rs.6,000 is guaranteed,\" says Shekhar in Jengarala. Even where it is less, it is still a burden for families drowning in debt. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The thing is meant to be entirely free,\" says a disgusted Dr. Desam Sreenivasa Reddy in Kalyandurg, Anantapur. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"In any case, the role of the doctor is next to nil. The attender does most of the work. He cuts open the body. He dictates what he has found and the doctor merely takes notes. Few will do that attender's job. In one case, a man who had been transferred on promotion was held back because there was no one else to do this work.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nPost-mortem problems\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHowever, it is not just the farmers' suicides that see post-mortem problems.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs Dr. Reddy says: \"When it's a medico-legal case, the pressures become intense. And the role of some of the forensic people is terrible. What happens if you call a murder a murder and it upsets somebody really powerful? Those involved can and will be bullied to fix the result. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere have been controversies over a couple of exhumations, too. Their final verdict is in doubt. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt some point down the line, people begin to wonder: why fight and get into trouble? Why not just take the money? This logic of `why not make some money' has now extended to the suicides as well.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"All that, however,\" say Dr. Reddy and Dr. Geyanand, \"in no way justifies this extortion. Nor the harassment of those unable to resist.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBoth doctors are with the Jana Vignyana Vedika, a body that aims to promote popular science and the scientific temper. The JVV, of which Dr. Geyanand is State president, has been active in tracking many aspects of the ongoing agrarian crisis.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe after-death business is widespread. The family of Duggala Mallappa in Anantapur spent close to Rs.10,000 after his death.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n In the case of Gobaribai, whose husband Kamali Nayak committed suicide in Vajrakarur, it cost Rs.6,000. \"We raised it through a <i>chanda</i> [contribution] from all our friends,\" says this Adivasi family. It was over Rs.3,000 for the extremely poor Dalit family of Pandhi Posaiah who took his life in Chinnarevali in Mahbubnagar. All Posaiah's sons are bonded labourers. They took the money on loan.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nAdding to the debt\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>In Akapur, Nizamabad, the family of Ponnala Hanumantha Reddy borrowed Rs.5,000 for this. They are already Rs.5 lakh in debt. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>There were some families that escaped without paying anything. Like those of Dasari Mahendru in Anantapur and Sangolla Narasimhulu in Medak who spent nothing. And where the usual actors were more sensitive. But these were not many. In the case of Mahendru, neighbours joked that \"even the police found nothing to squeeze here.\" \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>But it is the families that did not seek a post-mortem who today face more trouble. How do they now prove it was a suicide? \"This is a huge problem,\" says Dr. Reddy. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>\"How will they get their compensation if they cannot prove it?\" More so if the death occurred a while ago. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>The family of Prathap Reddy in Chelmada who killed himself in May 2003 in Medak now wishes they had sought one. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1><el1><el1>\"They simply did not have the money at the time,\" says a neighbour.

Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) data obtained by  <i>The Hindu</i>  confirm this. Even if the average annual premium was as low as Rs.2,000, it would mean policyholders lost over Rs.100 crores in this brief period. The real figure could be much higher. Most were farmers bankrupted in the ongoing agrarian crisis. Some of the years seeing the largest number of lapsed policies also saw the highest numbers of suicides by farmers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBesides, these figures only cover policies that lapsed after the first year. Many others paid a second annual instalment before going bankrupt. Those sums could be even larger.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nAgrarian crisis\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince 1991, farmers hit by the crisis in this State have lost hundreds of crores of rupees in lapsed policies. In Anantapur district alone, large numbers of farmers and agricultural workers have suffered such losses. As the agrarian crisis swept the district, tens of thousands facing bankruptcy could no longer pay the premiums on their LIC `Endowment' policies. Many paid between Rs.1,000 and Rs.2,000 for the first two years and then went broke.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor the policies to stay alive, they ought to have paid the premiums for at least three successive years. Now, the minimum value of any new insurance that they take out has climbed from Rs.20,000 to Rs.50,000 \u0097  an increase of 150 per cent. So new policies are beyond the reach of most farmers, hit by repeated crop failure.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe damage has been on from 1991. In just the Cuddapah division alone, over 4.3 lakh policies have lapsed since that year. The \"corresponding premium value\" of these is over Rs.61 crores. The years seeing the highest \"dropouts\" were 2000-01 to 2002-03. In those three years, the number of lapsed policies was 66,683, 75,390, and 71,029 respectively.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the same three years, in Anantapur, which falls in this division, there were 696, 699, and 640 officially recorded suicides. Mostly, bankrupt farmers taking their lives in despair. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nSuicides &amp; dropouts\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe actual suicide numbers are believed to be higher. There is then a clear link between the deepening rural distress and the \"dropouts.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe LIC can hardly be blamed for this. That distress flowed from larger economic processes and policies over which it had no control. But the question now is what the corporation can do to help its battered clients in this situation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome officials say that if the all-Andhra Pradesh figures went back to 1991, the money lost by rural policyholders unable to keep up with payments might cross Rs.1,000 crores.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Anantapur district alone, the money lost this way runs to crores of rupees. In just the Kadiri branch of Anantapur, the figure forfeited could be over Rs.10 crores. And this is not even one of the top three branches in the district. The affected farmers are simply unable to pay. Thus, policies meant to help people have turned against them in a period of crisis.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

Or churches. This single panchayat of Wayanad district has some 27 of them. Together with Pulpally next door, that number crosses 35.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith its cash crops of pepper, coffee, cardamom, tea and spices, this district has been one of the biggest foreign exchange earners of Kerala. And the churches, says K.M. Thomas, a farmer with four acres here, are \"a symbol of prosperity. Locals took pride in building them.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe `locals' were mainly from the central and other parts of Kerala. Vast streams of settlers  came mostly after World War II to this beautiful little Adivasi region on the north-eastern tip of the State. The strength and support of the Church made Wayanad a godsend for the settlers. (Indeed, one place in Mullankolly is called \"Parudeesa\" \u0097  Paradise). And so churches \u0097  built in thanks \u0097  dot the landscape in great profusion.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nChurches in trouble\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut the churches themselves \u0097  of most denominations \u0097  are now in trouble. Together, they have lost crores of rupees in a very short time. The Malankara Catholic Church alone may have seen a loss of Rs.70 lakhs in just the past year. Many places of worship have seen their Sunday collections fall to 10 per cent of normal. Monthly contributions are also down quite badly. A few churches work out of unfinished buildings. There is no money to complete their construction.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1>Many well-off parishes that once donated lakhs of rupees to their diocese centres now depend on the latter for life-support. Some priests have not got their meagre salaries for months. Weddings are far fewer than they were just five years ago. Which means that the two per cent charge on dowries that some churches extract also adds up to much less these days.\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFeasts and other activities occur less often. Students at some church-run schools \u0097  by far the best in Wayanad \u0097  struggle to pay even the nominal fees there. At least one church-run hospital with 20 beds in Mullankolly has shut its doors. Farmlands owned by most religious orders lie fallow and the income from these has crashed.\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt all has to do with two words: \"<i>kaarshika prathisanthi</i>.\" Or agrarian crisis. A phrase now firmly locked into the local lexicon. For many, regardless of faith or profession, this is Paradise Lost.\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe crisis sweeping Wayanad did receive much attention in April-May. At that time it was also sharpened by drought. And by Quick Wilt, a disease that withered the pepper vines. Long after that phase has passed, the damage deepens. The crisis itself, which goes far beyond those disasters, is entrenched. It now reflects in every sphere of life.\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"With farming in trouble, everything will be affected,\" says Fr. George Vettikatil. He is Procurator at the Catholic Bishop's House in Sultan Bathery. And has a keen sense of how deep the process is biting. \"Our links are to small farmers and daily wage labourers. So the impact of all this is greater on our members. That has to reflect in how the church is doing. If they starve, it affects us.\"\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMullankolly with 33,000 people and Pulpally with about 35,000, are where the Church is strongest. This is pepper territory. The huge fall in prices has savaged the district. And more so this region. Pepper prices have fallen from Rs. 27,000 a quintal in 1997 to about Rs. 5,400 a quintal now. In just two months of July and August this year, prices dropped by Rs. 900 a quintal. Grown on some 70,000 hectares, pepper keeps tens of thousands of farmers going here.\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nLethal mix\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPrice rigging, the dumping of imports and crop failure have proved a lethal mix. \"Foreign and domestic corporate and trade cartels are behind the price crash,\" says P. A. Muhammad, Convener of the South Indian Farmers Co-ordination Committee (SIFCO). \"Those in coffee, pepper and tea in this district\" he points out, \"have suffered a loss of at least Rs. 1,003 crores a year since 2001. On pepper alone, cultivators have lost Rs. 1500 crores since that year.\"\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Church is the central social organisation of this belt. (In Mullankolly alone, over 60 per cent of people are Christians.) Thousands of small farmers are its members. So the chaos on the ground affects it strongly. Besides, the Church itself is a cultivator. Almost every place of worship owns some land on which it grows pepper and coffee. And employs labour. The Malankara Catholic Church has some 45 parishes, each of which own between three and five acres. It also has what the Coffee Board terms `a model coffee plantation' at Nambiarkunnu. And a 90-acre coffee and pepper plantation at Kattikulam.\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Last year,\" says Fr. Vettikatil, \" we got just Rs. 50,000 from those 90 acres.\" In better times, that should have been Rs. 20 lakhs. Besides, each of the 45 parishes used to give between Rs. 1 lakh and  Rs. 2 lakh every year to the diocese centre. Their farm base wrecked, most now depend on the centre. \r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe effects are across the board. \"Our members, so many of them small farmers, have been badly hit,\" says Fr. A.K. Varghese in Padichira. \"Most cannot pay their dues and are in arrears.\" A retired professor of English, he is the Vicar of the St. George Orthodox Church in Kolavalli. Fr. Varghese himself has not seen his salary for some months now.\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Mullankolly, Fr. Jose Mundakal of the St. Mary's Church confirms the picture. This church has about 1,000 families affiliated with or attending it. Sunday collections the week we visited, he says, \"were below Rs. 500.\" That's 10 times less than what they touched in the good days.\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Almost 100 per cent of our members are farmers,\" says Fr. Mundakal. \"They have suffered a lot. Five years ago, the Feast of Our Lady, the main one at this church, was sponsored by just one person. Today, that's impossible. No one can afford it.\"\r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nMany suicides\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p><p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe crisis, of which the price fall has been one major part, has sparked off many suicides. \"Small and marginal farmers have been devastated,\" says N. Surendran. A small farmer himself, he is also district secretary of the Indian Farmers Movement (INFAM). \"Yes, drought and disease hurt us. And this high-pesticide chemical farming model must also go.

Students at some church-run schools \u0097  by far the best in Wayanad \u0097  struggle to pay even the nominal fees there. At least one church-run hospital with 20 beds in Mullankolly has shut its doors. Farmlands owned by most religious orders lie fallow and the income from these has crashed.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt all has to do with two words: \"<i>kaarshika prathisanthi</i>.\" Or agrarian crisis. A phrase now firmly locked into the local lexicon. For many, regardless of faith or profession, this is Paradise Lost.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe crisis sweeping Wayanad did receive much attention in April-May. At that time it was also sharpened by drought. And by Quick Wilt, a disease that withered the pepper vines. Long after that phase has passed, the damage deepens. The crisis itself, which goes far beyond those disasters, is entrenched. It now reflects in every sphere of life.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"With farming in trouble, everything will be affected,\" says Fr. George Vettikatil. He is Procurator at the Catholic Bishop's House in Sultan Bathery. And has a keen sense of how deep the process is biting. \"Our links are to small farmers and daily wage labourers. So the impact of all this is greater on our members. That has to reflect in how the church is doing. If they starve, it affects us.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMullankolly with 33,000 people and Pulpally with about 35,000, are where the Church is strongest. This is pepper territory. The huge fall in prices has savaged the district. And more so this region. Pepper prices have fallen from Rs. 27,000 a quintal in 1997 to about Rs. 5,400 a quintal now. In just two months of July and August this year, prices dropped by Rs. 900 a quintal. Grown on some 70,000 hectares, pepper keeps tens of thousands of farmers going here.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nLethal mix\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPrice rigging, the dumping of imports and crop failure have proved a lethal mix. \"Foreign and domestic corporate and trade cartels are behind the price crash,\" says P. A. Muhammad, Convener of the South Indian Farmers Co-ordination Committee (SIFCO). \"Those in coffee, pepper and tea in this district\" he points out, \"have suffered a loss of at least Rs. 1,003 crores a year since 2001. On pepper alone, cultivators have lost Rs. 1500 crores since that year.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Church is the central social organisation of this belt. (In Mullankolly alone, over 60 per cent of people are Christians.) Thousands of small farmers are its members. So the chaos on the ground affects it strongly. Besides, the Church itself is a cultivator. Almost every place of worship owns some land on which it grows pepper and coffee. And employs labour. The Malankara Catholic Church has some 45 parishes, each of which own between three and five acres. It also has what the Coffee Board terms `a model coffee plantation' at Nambiarkunnu. And a 90-acre coffee and pepper plantation at Kattikulam.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Last year,\" says Fr. Vettikatil, \" we got just Rs. 50,000 from those 90 acres.\" In better times, that should have been Rs. 20 lakhs. Besides, each of the 45 parishes used to give between Rs. 1 lakh and  Rs. 2 lakh every year to the diocese centre. Their farm base wrecked, most now depend on the centre. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe effects are across the board. \"Our members, so many of them small farmers, have been badly hit,\" says Fr. A.K. Varghese in Padichira. \"Most cannot pay their dues and are in arrears.\" A retired professor of English, he is the Vicar of the St. George Orthodox Church in Kolavalli. Fr. Varghese himself has not seen his salary for some months now.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Mullankolly, Fr. Jose Mundakal of the St. Mary's Church confirms the picture. This church has about 1,000 families affiliated with or attending it. Sunday collections the week we visited, he says, \"were below Rs. 500.\" That's 10 times less than what they touched in the good days.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Almost 100 per cent of our members are farmers,\" says Fr. Mundakal. \"They have suffered a lot. Five years ago, the Feast of Our Lady, the main one at this church, was sponsored by just one person. Today, that's impossible. No one can afford it.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nMany suicides\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe crisis, of which the price fall has been one major part, has sparked off many suicides. \"Small and marginal farmers have been devastated,\" says N. Surendran. A small farmer himself, he is also district secretary of the Indian Farmers Movement (INFAM). \"Yes, drought and disease hurt us. And this high-pesticide chemical farming model must also go. But it is these free trade policies that have driven prices down.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<el1><el1>Meanwhile, says Fr.

Over half a million policies have lapsed in just 36 months from April 2001. The State's bankrupt farmers simply cannot keep up with payments. This period was also marked by hundreds of farmers' suicides.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Andhra Agriculture Minister, N. Raghuveera Reddy, is keen to see the revival of the policies. Mr. Reddy, who inherited a desperate rural crisis from his predecessors, says the State will do all in its power to help the process forward. \"These are farmers who have suffered for the last many years,\" he told  <i>The Hindu</i> . \"We appeal to the LIC and the Centre to join hands with us to bring these policies back to life. We ourselves will do everything we can.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"These are people who have lost their ability to renew in a situation of great distress,\" says the All-India Insurance Employees Association (AIIEA) president, N.M. Sundaram. \"The rules should not be used to punish them.\" There are other problems too. \"The incentive for agents to seek renewals declines with their falling commissions each year,\" says a senior government official. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor instance, on a premium of Rs. 2,000, the agent gets his best deal \u0097  Rs. 700 (35 per cent) \u0097  in the first year. In the second, it is only Rs. 150. By the fourth, he is getting just Rs. 100. \"Hence,\" says the official, \"he has no incentive to chase farmers to keep up with payments.\" In fairness to the agents though, even had they persisted, the farmers were clearly in no position to pay.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEither way, it is in the LIC's interest to revive the policies. For one thing, its clients need it. For another, the LIC makes money on these policies only after the second year. The first two years the money goes mostly for commissions, administrative and processing expenses.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNew policies\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, things are worse for those who would like to take out new policies. The minimum policy value they have to go in for now is Rs. 50,000 against Rs. 20,000 earlier on. \"This happened after the UPA Government came in,\" says an LIC staffer in Anantapur. The measure places insurance cover beyond the reach of poorer sections.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe NDA Government, too, made it worse for the rural poor. \"Earlier,\" says one LIC Officer, \"we had the Landless Agricultural Labour Group Insurance (LALGI). This gave free cover and Rs. 2,000 for any family of this class that lost its breadwinner. This was scrapped by the NDA.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA fax to the LIC Chairman on these issues drew an official response. A reply from the LIC's Executive Director, Central Office (PR &amp; CC) names \"... other schemes (that) have been launched\" in lieu of this one. And asserts that these too \"are subsidised schemes for which a social security fund was created.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nPressure\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt is not clear how any of this offsets the loss of LALGI. And the LIC is silent on why it was scrapped.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe ending of the scheme was strongly opposed by the AIIEA. \"Generally,\" says Mr. Sundaram, \"the LIC has come under pressure of a very unfair competition. Private insurance providers would never touch the poor sections that the LIC covers. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nGender bias\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the UPA Government says the regulator will ensure that private providers, too, fulfil their social obligations. But nothing has happened so far. With those providers free to concentrate on the profit-making top end of the spectrum, the LIC finds itself at a disadvantage. Yet, scrapping such schemes is wrong.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome schemes also have a curious gender bias. For instance, the Jana Raksha policy. \"This is one scheme,\" says the Ananatapur LIC staffer, \"that still allows policy holders a lower minimum value. Rs. 30,000 as against Rs. 50,000. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHowever, it is only for those below the age of 40. What's more, illiterate women and widows are excluded. However, oddly, illiterate men are not.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe official LIC response is that: \"There is a certain amount of moral hazard in insuring illiterate women, considering that the position of such women is not very enviable.\" Indeed, the LIC argues that these exclusions are made \"for the safety of such vulnerable people.\" And that the \"LIC too has done so taking relevant aspects into consideration.\" Curiously, there is no moral hazard associated with insuring illiterate men and widowers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This is absolutely archaic thinking based on outdated practices,\" says Mr. Sundaram. \"Some aspects are not clear, but this whole approach is quite wrong. It smacks of a gender bias.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe LIC says it has \"increased the minimum sum assured marginally\" for \"many of its plans.\" That is, \"from Rs. 30,000 to Rs.50,000.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Corporation says it did so bearing in mind the nature of India's insurance market, the low level of insurance penetration here and \"keeping certain other parameters like inflation etc. in consideration.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nSpecial campaigns\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nCan LIC act to protect farmers who are in dire straits? The Corporation's official response suggests it can. \"LIC floats special campaigns for revival apart from the regular revivals which are facilitated all through the year.\" It also points out that \"normally between November and January, special rebates are given on the late fee/interest portion.\" It lists some relaxations, including \"waiving of medical reports etc., on certain policies subject to certain conditions.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt also speaks of \"New Janaraksha,\" a plan it believes favours farmers. Here, \"if premia are paid for first two years, then the policy does not lapse even if further premia are not paid for the next three years and full risk on the life of the policyholder is covered,\" says the LIC. Also, the minimum sum assured in this policy \"has been retained at Rs. 30,000 only.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhich is encouraging. Except that any revival scheme needs the Government and LIC to act first. The bankrupt farmers are in no state to move on this individually. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAlso, the `special rebates' presently have a meagre limit of Rs. 250. Only a waiver of all dues will enable people to revive their policies. Since there are quite a few grounds on which the Andhra Government, the LIC and the AIIEA do agree, swift action on this front could revive policies worth crores and crores of rupees. A major benefit to farmers in big trouble.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"There can and should be special, even new, revival schemes for policyholders wanting to reactivate their insurance,\" says Mr. Sundaram. \"It should be possible here, as LIC will be dealing not with individuals but a whole group of people. The LIC can waive certain requirements, such as interest for example, if that stalls renewal. The All-India Insurance Employees Association will articulate and press this demand with the LIC and the Government of India.\" </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

Mani. His colleagues are missing. In the estate where he must labour on the Karnataka side of the border, Mani won't be allowed to work without the three-man team he promised. \"If the others don't show up, I have to go look for them,\" he says. \"Which means I will lose even more on bus fares and, quite likely, the day's wages as well.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThousands of people from Wayanad are crossing the border into Karnataka and Tamil Nadu every single day, looking for work. Several do this journey two or three times a week, sometimes more. Mani is just one amongst dozens jostling for space in the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation bus that carries us at this moment. Wayanad's rich cash-crop economy has fallen apart, shattering employment in the district. This single 6 a.m. bus from here to Kutta in Karnataka's Kodagu district clearly captures that process. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBus conductor Lawrence Jacob, who has been on this route since 1997, has watched it unfold. \"There were six trips a day to Kutta in 1995. Today, you are on the first of 24 trips daily \u0097  a 400 per cent increase.\" Prior to 1995, the KSRTC did not have a bus on this route.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLawrence, who is also an activist and local CITU leader, links the explosion in the traffic to Wayanad's ongoing agrarian crisis. \"The people in this bus will work in Kodagu district at half the wage they used to get here. That is, on those days that they do get work. Many are trapped into fake agreements which their new bosses have no intention of honouring. But they have no choice. There's no work in Wayanad.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFive years ago, says Lawrence, the bus was dominated by poor adivasis. They are still the main travellers and their numbers have grown. But now there are also many masons, carpenters, electricians, students and traders. Then there are non-adivasi farm labourers in large numbers. And small and medium farmers, too. A few of the latter trying to lease land cheaply in Kodagu to cultivate ginger and other cash crops. At home, it's all in a mess.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"When there was work in Wayanad,\" says Mani, \"I got a daily wage of up to Rs. 120. Now I work for Rs. 80 a day in Kolikuppa.\" It's worse than it looks. \"My bus fare to the place is Rs. 34 \u0097  one way.\"  Mani tries coping by doing the journey only three times a week and staying over the other days. \"It means I spend very little time with my family. But what's the way out? This slump in pepper and coffee prices really hit us.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nP. K. Siddique is an estate worker too, heading for Kodagu. He gets Rs. 75 a day. \"And no bus fare,\" he laughs. Which means he pays the Rs. 27 it costs to his particular stop and back.  Besides him sits Shinoj Thomas, a mason. With his skills, he can make up to Rs.150 a day in Karnataka minus the Rs. 30 he spends on bus tickets. \"But I get a maximum of 15-20 days work in a month,\" he says.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"All work in Wayanad has come to a standstill,\" says Thomas. \"Just see the countless unfinished houses in the district. These houses were begun when farming was doing well. Once the crisis came along, construction ceased. No one had any money to continue. That's why we work across the border for much less than what we used to earn in Wayanad.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWe're just past the second stop and the bus is already more than full. It has 48 seats, but with over 20 standees it now carries around 70 people. Not all 24 trips travel this full, but 55 to 60 would be the average, says conductor Lawrence. \"there's at least 1200 people on this route daily,\" he says. \"And that goes up quite a bit on market day. Mind you, the ticket cost (Rs.13.50 till Kutta) is higher now than it was a few years ago. Yet, the numbers of people going has shot up in these past two years.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Construction workers used to come to Wayanad, not leave it,\" K. Nirmalan, a KSRTC workers' union leader at the Sulthan Bathery depot had told us. \"Then construction stopped. Plantations drew a lot of workers. Then those went into lockouts and closures. Earlier pepper was booming. Now that's gone. Even this rise in outgoing buses doesn't tell the whole story. There are many services other than KSRTC's. Those of the other states \u0097  and also a host of illegal ones.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany on the bus, like Shinoj Thomas, had not ventured out before 2002. Now they do so in thousands. Buses on most outgoing routes have doubled to cope with the flow. That from several centres \u0097  and not just to Kutta. The basic story is one of comprehensive collapse of employment in Wayanad. Each traveller out of the district reflects that in his or her own way. Thousands of people, their earnings halved or worse, seek unsteady work across the border.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA little over an hour later, in Kutta, a dejected B.J. Mani says his colleagues have not shown up for work. \"I'll have to go back looking for them. \"My whole day will be gone, not to speak of the bus fare.\" He boards the return bus an hour later. Meanwhile, new loads of workers descend from the incoming bus. People mill around waiting for transport that will take them further into Kodagu. A group of seven young carpenters from Wayanad is amongst them. \"I've been doing this for two years,\" says A.M. Biju from the group. \"We will stay a month in Karnataka in a room provided by the man we are working for. Before, there was a lot of work in Wayanad. Now there is none, so here we are. That is our story.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOn the bus to Kutta, everybody has a story.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

Only, there isn't any left. \"The last two years killed us,\" says Manager Babu Thomas in Padichira. \"Before that it ran well for almost 20. We lost Rs.60,000 each year in 2002 and 2003. After that, it could not continue for long.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt didn't. \"Prateeksha\" (`Hope' in Malayalam) lies locked and deserted. And has been that way for some months now. \"The last movie was a new one at the time here,\" says Thomas. \"A Mohan Lal film \u0097  <i>Mister Brahmachari</i> \u0097  it should have done well. But it did quite badly. There were no audiences.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhy? \"The general disaster of this district reflects in our own. That's the main thing. The agrarian crisis has destroyed the spending power of our audiences. And it's not just us. Five theatres across Wayanad have closed down in 24 months. Another six or seven are facing closure.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe damage engulfing this once-rich cash-crop region now touches every sphere. \"The collapse of the pepper price was a huge blow. Then the closure of so many plantations. With that, labour had no money to buy tickets,\" says Thomas. \"Then the migrations, too, hit us.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMajor tea and other plantations have shut down, throwing thousands out of work in the past two years. Besides, the Tamil migrant labourers that employment once drew in tens of thousands are far fewer now. Further, out-migration of local labour desperate for work also hit the cinema business. Prateeksha's 500 seats went empty some days.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Often, towards the end, we just had to cancel some shows. Over two years ago, we sold 250 tickets or more daily and had three shows. Then agriculture failed and so did wages. Our sales fell to 100 tickets. (Upper class seats cost Rs.12 and lower Rs.10.) In the last months, we sometimes came down to only one show a day, selling just 20-25 tickets for it.\" Eight months ago, the staff \u0097  Thomas, the projectionist and the gatekeeper \u0097  brought down the curtains for the last time.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTheatre Swagat in Pulpally had closed down earlier. Fully dependent on migrant labourers, it showed only Tamil films. \"When the plantation economy collapsed, so did we. Tamil workers stopped coming,\" says M. Jose, Swagat's owner. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Where is the money to go to the cinema,\" asks T. Rajan, a mason in Pulpally's Tamil colony, Meenankolly. \"Our people are in fact leaving Wayanad in large numbers. There used to be 500 families here. Now, less than 100. There 's no work to be had at all.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Before the trouble began, we used to pull in up to Rs.2,500 a day,\" says Jose. \"We sold maybe 250 tickets (rates: Rs.13 and Rs.9) and ran three shows daily. With the crisis, this fell to two screenings. Then came days on which there were 10-15 people in the audience. I had to cancel such shows. Our running cost was Rs. 800 daily. And too many days we made less than half that.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nJose plans to build his residence where Swagat now stands. \"Anyway, only the front fa\u00e7ade and the projection room were pucca. The rest is just a shed.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRaman Kutty has no such options in Irulam. He spent a fortune building `Ragini' as a permanent cinema when Wayanad's economy was booming. \"It's put me Rs.30 lakhs in debt,\" he says ruefully. \"Today we have a new film, first show \u0097  and an audience of 11.\" (The film: <i>Killukil Pambaram</i> \u0097  Spinning Top.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"In 1988,\" says his son, E.R. Gopinathan, \"we paid tax of Rs.10,000 to the panchayat each week. Now we are paying Rs. 300 a week. Things slowed down for us since 1991, but the past three years have been terrible. We would gladly sell this theatre \u0097  but there are no buyers.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDid the television/VCR revolution trigger the decline of cinema in Wayanad? After all, the richer locals live in what Kutty calls \"the TV, video, CD / DVD age.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBabu Thomas is dismissive. \"We went through that phase much earlier. The maximum impact of that was the loss of 20 per cent of our customers. We still did fairly well. Our main audience was poorer workers and migrants. They do not own TV sets, let alone VCRs. No, the agrarian distress finished us.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Television did cause us problems,\" says Raman Kutty. \"But the past three years demolished us. Take the two large plantations near my theatre. Both are in collapse. The number of workers is down. The migrants are down. Wages are down. Pepper, coffee, everything is down. Only debt is up.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"My audiences had no television, cable or CDs. Only theatres,\" says Jose at Swagat. \"They were almost entirely Tamil migrants.\" The destruction of their earnings killed his theatre. All the owners are clear that while several factors hurt them, \"what destroyed us was \"kaarshika prathisanthi\" \u0097  the agrarian crisis.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBabu Thomas adds one bizarre reason to the rest. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The coming of the women's Self-Help Groups (SHGs) also undercut us,\" he says. When families went out to see films, he observes, women were the driving force. (The men would rather have hung out and had a drink.) \"But poor workers have only one day off weekly. And once the ladies started holding their SHG meetings on their weekly holiday, it added to our decline.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOne of the earliest theatres to close down was `Jyothis' in Vythiri. Owners T.J. Kurien and Mercy Verghese cite all the reasons the others do. But add that \"audience tastes have also been corrupted by sexually-loaded films.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThey call these `Shakila-trend' movies, after the famous actress of that genre. But other owners insist those films are not doing well either.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMercy Verghese is retired headmistress of a Roman Catholic high school. \"We had another theatre by the same name in Thariode,\" she says \"That one too, we shut down. Where once we made Rs. 2,000 a day, we were getting less than Rs. 300. Honest people cannot run theatres profitably these days.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe devout owners of `Jyothis' have allowed the one in Vythiri to be converted into a church. Perhaps appropriate for a theatre whose name means Divine Light.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>

She did not board at the point of origin, Mananthavady in Kerala, as we did. But from the Begur adivasi colony in between. She will go on further to Nathayal \"to do weeding work in an estate there.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHer face and her walk betray her fatigue. Like on every other day, she's been up since 4 a.m. \"I have two children and a husband down with TB,\" she explains. She has to finish cooking, cleaning, washing and get things ready for the children to go to school. \"And I have to leave by 7 a.m. to reach here in time for work. Here, the sahucar's vehicle will pick me and others up to take us to his estate.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere, Bimala will earn Rs. 50 for her weeding work, which keeps her bending for eight hours in the sun. But she will lose Rs.15 each day on bus tickets. She takes her food from home. \"At the work place we get nothing. Not even a cup of tea.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt home, where she reaches after 7 p.m. there's still much to be done. Including trips every two or three days to Kattikulam (bus fare Rs.3.50 each way) to buy provisions. Since Bimala has very little cash in hand at any given moment, she cannot buy enough at one time and thus reduce the number of trips she makes. So, this often cuts further into the Rs.35 she scrapes out of her trips to Nathayal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOn whatever is left she looks after two young sons (in the 8th and 9th standard) and a sick husband who cannot work. Bimala sleeps at ten p.m. or after, most nights. The family survives and runs on her 16-18 hour workday and the Rs.25-30 it leaves her with. She answers the questions put to her by Prof. Balagopal of St. Mary's College and Krishna Prasad of the Karshaka Sangham (Kisan Sabha) without self-pity.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Our Begur colony has 60 families and all are in the same condition,\" she explains. \"Most come here like me, seeking work. I've done this for four years. The only thing is, I hardly ever see the children awake.\" Wayanad's already marginalised adivasis have been pushed deeper into debt and penury by a crisis that has sharply reduced any employment they could get. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEarlier, too, the large-scale conversion of paddy fields into cash crop farms deprived adivasi women of countless workdays each year. Paddy transplantation had till then been a major source of work for them. Besides, \"we used to get some weeding and other work closer by, in the forest.\" But the Forest Department has cut that to a minimum. And the plantations \u0097  even those launched by the state for adivasi welfare \u0097  are in the doldrums.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNow with the district's economy crumbling, those like Bimala, always on the margin, have simply been crushed. She has been travelling on the bus to Kutta a lot longer than the non-adivasi job seekers. Together their numbers are huge. The explosion of bus services from Wayanad to obscure points in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka reflects this. Scores of services have sprung up along routes where there were few or none just four years ago.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"They come in ever larger numbers,\" says M.K. Mohammad in Kutta, in Kodagu district. He works in the local mosque and has seen the job hunters from across the border swell from a trickle to a flood. \"Yes, there is more work in Kodagu. After all, this side of the border there are huge holdings \u0097  up to 2,000 acres. But this giant tide of people means that the work is getting less. And, obviously, wages are getting much lower.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBack in Wayanad, the only earnings that have risen are those of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation. Little known destinations in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu now bring in higher earnings per kilometre (EPKM) than bus services to major cities within Kerala. The bus to Kutta rivals \u0097  and on some days exceeds \u0097  the EPKM of the service to Kozhikode. This is also true of buses to Pattavayal and Gudalur in Tamil Nadu.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Out-migration has increased,\" says P. K. Chandran, district transport officer at the KSRTC office in Sulthan Bathery. \"This is new. Five years ago, there were just three or four trips a day to Pattavayal. Now there are 32 trips daily. Indeed, that route is the best revenue earner for KSRTC from this Bathery depot, alongside Kozhikode.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe soaring number of out-bound bus trips signals the intensity of Wayanad's agony. Unlike much of the rest of Kerala, this district never saw major out-migration. It's cash crop wealth ensured quite the reverse.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Till 2002, people came here in great numbers, seeking work,\" K. N. Subramanian had told us. He is a district leader of the Karshaka Sangham (a unit of the All-Indian Kisan Sabha). \"The Pulpally region alone drew almost ten thousand migrant workers. Mostly from Tamil Nadu.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOther districts exported labour to the Gulf. But Wayanad, says Subramanian, \"was known as `the Gulf of Kerala.' The Pulpally-Mullankolly region was called `The Kuwait of Kerala.' It gave work to thousands.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut even some who once provided a bit of that work now seek it themselves in Karnataka. P.V. Poulose, K. Biju and E.V. Babu are farmers from Wayanad getting down with us at Kutta. Together, they are leasing ten acres at a total cost of Rs.1 lakh in Barnani near Mysore. Crushed by the crisis at home in Mananthavady, they're going in for ginger cultivation in Barnani. This is a high-risk game, with ginger attracting a lot of problems from pest to theft. Not to speak of the environmental damage their chemical farming model entails.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nInput costs and other risks, too, are very high. Their finances are thinly stretched and failure would bankrupt them. \"We have no choice,\" says Poulose. \"We have to offset our losses at home which have been severe these past three years.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile a new busload of people arrives in Kutta from across the border. The agrarian crisis has transformed a district known till now for in-migration into one seeing huge, anarchic out-migration. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

Understand our problems as well,'' said M. Uttaman, mild reproof in his voice. And what is his profession? ``I own a toddy shop.''\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nShouldn't you be doing much better these days, journalist K.A. Shaji gently asks. After all, in this kind of depression, people must be drinking a lot more. They are, says a morose Uttaman, but not toddy. ``This arrack from across the border is killing us.''\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``The fall in the purchasing power of the poor in Wayanad hit us very badly,'' says the toddy shop owner. ``We pay a heavy fee to the Government for our licenses. In the middle of this agrarian crisis, where our clients are earning nothing, this has become a burden. Then when cheap and strong arrack is smuggled in from Karnataka, it just destroys the economics of our trade.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nThreat from across the border\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nToddy is legal in Kerala, while arrack is banned. Also, while a litre of toddy costs Rs. 30, a sachet of arrack goes for Rs. 11. As the farm crisis sees thousands of migrants crossing over into Karnataka, arrack shops right on the border are booming. Travellers from Wayanad can find one within a minute's walk of most bus stops they get down at in Karnataka. One shop, just across the river Kabini in Byrekuppa, accounts for a good bit of the boat traffic to that town. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nUttaman's reading of the damage arrack is doing to his trade is quite accurate. Take Kutta in Kodagu, Karnataka. There are four arrack joints around this tiny town. In the first ten minutes we spend in one of them, a dozen customers come in, buy several sachets and move on. Some consume a couple of the sachets on the spot and pack the rest that they buy. All this brisk activity in the morning \u0097  the leanest period for such shops.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nDoomed trade\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOn an average, these four small shops together sell around 5,000 sachets of arrack daily. (A lot more on market days.) This means they are making around Rs. 55,000 each day. Or a stunning combined annual turnover of close to Rs. 2 crore in a single town of less than 6,500 people. Which implies that the trade all along the border runs to tens of crores of rupees. Uttaman's toddy trade does appear doomed.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nKutta's own buyers simply do not support such volumes. So who does? Bus traffic from Wayanad to Kutta has gone up 400 per cent in recent times. Wayanad's rich cash-crop economy has collapsed. And over 1,000 people from there touch this point daily, seeking work on this, the Karnataka side of the border. The main revenue for the arrack shops comes from these and other travellers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nA source of income\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor some, it's a source of income in these desperate times. ``It all happened when agriculture crashed in Wayanad,'' says Uttaman. ``Labourers cannot get a day's work here. So now, some go to Karnataka and buy 15 packets of arrack and return to sell them in Wayanad. They cost Rs. 11 but sell here for over Rs. 25 and even more. This undercuts us badly.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``A typical arrival,'' says C.C. Subbaiah Surat in Kutta, ``might buy six sachets.'' He is a local businessman and BJP activist. ``Two packets he consumes on the spot. The rest he takes back and sells at home. There he will get at least Rs. 25 a packet or more.'' An investment of Rs. 66 can earn its owner Rs. 100. Minus the bus fare and the cost of the two packets consumed \u0097  it still leaves over a few rupees. In short, it's almost a self-financing scheme. In the midst of Wayanad's economic chaos, those at the bottom scrape around for ways out. This seems to be one of them \u0097  arrack as a distress trade. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nIllicit brewing\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAdding to the complexity is the illicit brewing of arrack in Wayanad's own villages. A number of marginal farmers and landless workers, both settlers and adivasis, are into this now. They see no other way of tiding over the ongoing crisis. At least this brings in some income, however meagre, at a time when all other avenues have failed. There is also some brewing of bootleg in remote parts of the forest, beyond police and excise department reach. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor Uttaman, though, it all adds up to bankruptcy. ``I pay the Government a yearly license fee of Rs.48,000,'' he says. ``Then there is the welfare fund payment for my eight employees, which is almost a lakh of rupees. We tap nearly 120 litres of toddy a day. Remember it's a perishable good. If you can't sell it in 48 hours, you throw it away.'' Since toddy is a major item in Wayanad and closely linked to the employment of many, the issue gets more tricky.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``Five years ago, I sold 250 bottles a day. Now that's down to just 10 or 15 daily. Toddy fetches Rs. 30 a litre. But the tapper gets his daily wage of Rs. 22 regardless of how it goes. To add to it all, the bootleg mafia around here also undercuts us further. This business is cracking.'' So are a host of others. Many small shops and provision stores around here have folded. Some now work only 6:30 am to 9 am and then again from 5 pm to 7 pm. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``It's across the board,'' says Uttaman grimly. He locates his problem clearly within the agrarian crisis that has crushed Wayanad's economy. ``The cinemas have closed, so have the teashops. Pepper, coffee, cardamom \u0097  everything is doing badly. People have no money,'' he says. What are the options? ``It seems to me the pressure is so great that some toddy shops, too, will start buying and selling arrack on the sly. How do you expect people to survive?''\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p

But the waiter was firm. \"We have Nescafe.\" This is coffee territory, yet you cannot get the local brew in any restaurant here. Drop in at the Coffee Board in Kalpetta to enquire why this is so \u0097  and they offer you a cup of tea. \"We do have a filter,\" our host apologises, \"but there's no powder in the office just now.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are tonnes of powder everywhere else. Wayanad produces 82 per cent of Kerala's coffee. It has been a huge income and foreign exchange earner for years. But it is now deeply enmeshed in the crisis sweeping the region. And its volatile reign extends far beyond the district. Coffee is the second most highly traded commodity in the world after oil. (Third if we count narcotics.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The collapse of coffee prices has ruined countless farmers in the district,\" says M.P. Veerendrakumar. He represents Wayanad in the Lok Sabha and is a former Union Labour Minister. \"So many lives are tied to that crop,\" he says. There are over 70,000 hectares under coffee here and some 60,000 small growers. \"The slide in prices is a key element in the farmers' suicides that have occurred.\" Almost all the suicide-hit households we surveyed here were small growers of coffee and pepper. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMaria Kutty with her 1.5 acres in Irulam. E.D. Vasu with 75 cents in Edavaka. Mohammed Ali with 58 cents in Porunnannur. These were just three of many farmers sunk by the price of coffee and pepper. Their debts rose as farm-gate prices fell. They, and some 120 others like them, committed suicide during 2004. \"Maria took her life after a local bank sent her a notice,\" says a neighbour. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAll this is well known here. Yet, last December, Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath told the Lok Sabha the Centre had received no information on coffee grower suicides in the State. \"Retail prices are not doing badly,\" points out Mr. Veerendrakumar. \"It's the producer's price that has plummeted.\" Coffee prices dropped to a low of Rs.15-16 a kg for the raw cherry by mid-2004. \"This from a high of Rs.70 - 80 a kg for the cherry. And up to Rs.130 a kg for the beans only a few years ago.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nCoffee still makes big bucks at the global level. But Wayanad's growers have lost over Rs.800 crore on it since 2001. \"Foreign and domestic cartels and trading houses are behind the price crash,\" says P.A. Muhammed. He is Convenor of the South Indian Farmers Coordination Committee. And he knows it's a worldwide story.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn 1992, points out Martin Khor of Third World Network, \"producer countries earned $10 billion from a global market worth around $30 billion. In 2002, they made less than $6 billion in a market that had doubled in size.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat cataclysmic drop in share of revenue from 33 per cent to less than 10 per cent within a decade hit poor producers worldwide. Wayanad briefly saw a great rise in prices in the late 1990s when frost hit the Brazilian crop. \"And also because,\" says a senior Government official who has tracked exports for two decades, \"of sheer rigging. Four major companies dominate the world market. When faced with a worker's strike in Brazil, they hike prices for Kerala coffee. So there's a boom. When the crushed Brazilians return to the fields, the companies pull the plug on us. Now they have two major, cheap sources.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWayanad's exposure is worse than most because its coffee has no internal market. Unlike Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is not a coffee drinking land. Wayanad is home to one of the best Robusta varieties anywhere. Yet there is little effort to promote coffee within the district or State. Expensive but poor quality instant coffee rules the roost here\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHotel owners can buy high quality, fresh Wayanad coffee powder for Rs.90 a kg. \"But the price of one kilo of instant coffee from Nestle,\" points out P. A. Muhammed, \"is between Rs.900 and Rs. 1,400 a kg.\" And imports of instant brands that use the cheapest beans \u0097  and lots of advertising \u0097  are on the rise. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Nine-tenths of the price you pay for your instant coffee,\" says the journal <i>New Internationalist</i>, \"goes to powerful companies who ship, roast and retail the product. Just one-twentieth reaches the people whose lives are spent growing and harvesting it.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhy buy costly instant stuff when top quality fresh coffee is available? \"It is absurd that Wayanad coffee is not drunk here,\" says A.P. Sreekumar, a big grower and district Congress leader. \"But there has never been any branding for our coffee. It's never been promoted locally.\" Our host at the Coffee Board goes further. \"This is the land of coffee and no one knows how to prepare it.\" Others charge the Board with only serving exporters. Not growers.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is also little processing of coffee within the district. \"If you try doing it,\" says Mr. Muhammed, \"the buyers boycott you.\" Most in Wayanad are clear that state action is urgent and essential. More so in areas like credit and a minimum support price. Also by revising import policies and helping growers do their own curing and processing.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The cartels have strong local links. And sometimes they encourage over-production,\" says the senior Government official. \"That works well to keep prices down. At the same time, their control over the market and our lack of access ensures their profits don't fall. Only our prices do.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe global market has too much coffee. Often hundreds of millions of kg more than it needs. \"Eight per cent more coffee is being produced than consumed,\" says OXFAM.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe price crash has devastated Wayanad's growers. \"They may be getting three paise on each rupee that coffee generates,\" says Mr. Veerendrakumar. \"How can the farmers survive?\" Last year, too many of them decided they just couldn't. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>

For the first time since perhaps the late 1950s, even Bishops of the church have joined people's protests. Some have flagged off marches taken out by the distressed farmers of Wayanad. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"People cannot even ensure their basic existence,\" says Father Baby Elias of the Mar Basil Church in Cheeyambam. Fr. Elias, a Jacobite, is also with the Indian Farmers Movement. INFAM is a body that has strongly raised farmers' issues. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMedia reports reckon that some 120 farmers have taken their own lives in Wayanad since January 9 this year. The Government admits to no more than 50 distress suicides in that time. On the surface, the figure of 120 may seem small beside, say, the suicides in Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. That district saw an average of 600 each year during a five-year period. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet, at one level, Wayanad's suicides are almost as intense. Anantapur has nearly 37 lakh people. Wayanad has some seven lakh. On that base, its 120 suicides add up to nearly the same as Anantapur's. (The data in both cases are flawed, but give us some sense of the trend.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarmers of Christian background might be more affected. Yet, the suicides of Wayanad have cut across faith and community. In the households we surveyed, those taking their lives included Hindus, Christians, Muslims, Adivasis and Dalits. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe numbers apart, the pain and intensity are real. A.C. Varkey, chairman of the Farmers Relief Forum is appalled by the trend. The FRF has launched some militant actions on farmers issues and plans more. \"We educate people and ask them not to commit suicide,\" says an angry Varkey. \"I say that if we must do that, let us do it <i>en masse</i> at the government headquarters. Make it an act of political struggle, not one of individual despair.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs in Anantapur, most see the suicides as just a symptom of a much wider crisis. One that has hit all sectors.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBy March this year \"every acre of land in the Mullankolly-Pulpally region carried a debt of Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh,\" says M. Prakash of the Brahmagiri Development Society. \"The price crash had made repayment of loans impossible,\" he points out. \"The five-fold drop in the price of pepper was a huge blow. Quick Wilt disease enhanced its impact.\" Growing debt, says Prakash, forced many to fell countless trees on their lands to sell the timber. In this ecologically fragile zone, \"that only doubled the damage.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the strongly Christian belt of Mullankolly-Pulpally that boasts over 35 churches, that chaos spills across the board. \"We are very concerned,\" says a worried Bishop Geevarghese Mar Divannasios at the Catholic Bishop's House in Sultan Bathery. \"The drought, the price crash, the disease, all have hurt people. As have changes in lifestyle. Of course we are anxious. Their suffering has to affect us.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt has. Church income has fallen sharply as the laity have gone into debt. But the larger reality is also more complex. While the church does reflect the pain of its farmer base, it is also, in some cases, a source of at least a few of the dues that worry them.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Waive all church dues,\" is the first slogan of a group of the faithful seeking relief. Benny Kurumbalakatu, state president of the Kerala Catholic Almaya Federation is clear about this. \"People gave generously to the church when they were doing well. The church must aid them when they are doing badly. When crisis hits their lives, religious authority must work to help them. That's regardless of the religion of those who are suffering.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"If church members fall behind in their dues, they suffer,\" says Benny. \"Baptisms, weddings, funerals, all rituals are put on hold until the members pay their arrears. When couples are at the altar, the priest raises the issue of the dues. I was present at one such marriage. This is unconscionable and should not happen.\" The couple at that wedding were unable to produce their Rs.1,500 arrears and Benny put up the money for them.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince the agrarian crisis hits everyone regardless of faith, his group asks for waivers that cover people of all religions. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"For instance, children in church-run schools are of diverse faiths. If their parents are unable to pay the fees, they must get concessions regardless of their religion. These waivers should apply to all those of farming backgrounds.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBenny shot off a letter to his Bishop this August on this count. His group's other demands include: those from farm backgrounds must get free treatment at hospitals linked to churches; job reservation for children of such backgrounds \u0097  of all religions \u0097  in church-related institutions. And all church groups must coordinate their resources to give financial aid to those in distress.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are churches of many hues and denominations in Wayanad. And some deny any pressure in recovery of dues from their members. \"We do not have such a dues system. So there is no compulsion in our set-up,\" Fr. Jose Mundakal of the St. Mary's Church in Mullankolly clarifies.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome others, however, do have such systems. And the pressure to change them is growing. \"Yes, there is a tradition and norm that dues must be cleared,\" says Fr. A. K. Varghese of St. George's Orthodox Church. \"You must know this is a discipline of the parishioners themselves, set in better times. Not a law from our side. Now no one can pay and we have relaxed these norms. For instance, two burials were sanctioned after 20 per cent of the dues were paid.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome dues systems are graded on a class basis \u0097  or `A, B, C, D' based on the earnings of the members. The amount for each group could vary with the church. But such practices are under stress. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Fr. Baby Elias' church too, things are happening. \"From last year, our general body meeting decided that the rule on delaying rituals for dues should not be enforced. Not in such a crisis.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Our parishioners are good people,\" says Fr. Varghese. \"But the times are such that all struggle to pay.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis belt may have over 35 churches. And the devout may have one within a few minutes walk. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut for too many right now, it's a case of so near to God, so far from Heaven. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>

The monarch consented. Were they around today, neither Vasco da Gama nor the King could certify that the pepper found here is from the Malabar.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This place is drowning in third-rate imported pepper,\" says E.M. Samad. He is a young trader shuttling between Wayanad and Delhi. \"Cheap, low grade imports are killing our pepper. This stuff is from Vietnam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and other places.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis massive inflow has savaged the growers here and knocked the bottom out of the district's economy. \"Wayanad farmers have lost Rs. 1,500 crores on pepper alone since 2001,\" says P.A. Muhammed, convenor of the South Indian Farmers Coordination Committee. \"Disease and drought have sharpened the crisis.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCheap imports\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe cheap imports have proved costly. \"The import lobby brings in these large amounts of bad pepper,\" says Mr. Samad. \"It mixes this with Wayanad pepper (which is premium grade) and exports it to Europe and elsewhere for huge profits. This triggered the price crash and killed the farmers of Wayanad.\" The district saw 150 farmers or more take their lives in 2004. Most of them pepper and coffee growers, all of them deep in debt. The spice of life now carries a whiff of death.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"As it is, production costs quadrupled in the past few years,\" says K.M. Thomas. His five-member family works a four-acre plot in the worst-hit region of Pulpally. \"This was our mainstay. Now we earn less from each acre than we invest in it.\" Pepper prices \u0097  Rs. 27,000 a quintal a few years ago \u0097  fell to just over Rs. 5,000 a quintal by 2004. Or Rs. 50 a kilo. Debts rose as prices sank. And credit dried up. In Pulpally, thriving farmers once owned hundreds of motor vehicles. Now many are off the roads, sold or lost in debt repayment.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\n\"Import duties needed\"\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nV. Baby was famous as the district's \"model farmer.\" Indeed, he had won the \"Best Farmer Award\" from banks here happy with his prompt loan repayment. Then came the price crash.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Pulpally pepper is the best in the world,\" says Mr. Baby with pride. \"But this inferior Sri Lankan product is hurting us like anything.\" As prices slipped, the model farmer found himself over half a million rupees in debt. Deeply hurting for a man proud of his fine record. And without credit, it is hard to come out of it. \"The Government should impose duties on these imports,\" he says. \"And there should be a five-year moratorium on loan repayment.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHowever, much of what passes as \"Sri Lankan pepper\" is really from many nations. It just comes via Sri Lanka. That country's output at the time the price slide began in 2001 was just around 7,800 tonnes. About half of this was locally consumed. Yet, Indian \"imports from Sri Lanka\" in the same period were almost higher than that nation's production! \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"There is zero duty levied on such imports from SAARC countries,\" points out M.P. Veerendrakumar. He is the Lok Sabha member from here and a former Union Labour Minister. \"So all this third rate pepper is routed through Sri Lanka. How can they export more than they produce? Multinationals and cartels are rigging both the flow and the price of pepper.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nDrop in output\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith prices smashed by the imports, output sank. Adding to the crisis was the onset of Quick Wilt disease and other problems. \"Four years ago, I harvested 70 quintals of pepper,\" says farmer K.I. Matthew in Mullankolly. \"In 2004, that fell to seven quintals.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLocals believe much damage might have been caused by inferior imported species entering the production chain. And by the reckless use of dubious seed varieties that crowd the market.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is no relief. \"Because ours are cash crops, there are no concessions,\" says K.N. Subramanian. He is a district leader of the Karshaka Sangham (a unit of the All-Indian Kisan Sabha) and himself a small farmer. \"The compensation levels are crazy. A dead banana tree gets Rs. 50. A destroyed pepper vine fetches Rs. 40, though pepper is a long-term crop. One you can earn from for half a century.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPepper from here has long been a big foreign exchange earner. Kerala accounts for 90 per cent of India's production. During 2003, Indian exports fell to 17,200 tonnes, a fall of 31 per cent from 2002. But black pepper remained the most favoured spice in the globe. The world consumes more of it than perhaps all other spices combined. Yet India's share of the trade has dived. And its imports have soared. Vietnam has emerged the globe's unlikely top producer.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nKerala's response has been to bureaucratise everything. \"The idea was that the government would buy pepper at Rs. 75 a kg from distressed farmers,\" says Kozhikode-based journalist K.A. Shaji. \"For this, farmers wishing to sell pepper must now have the local village officer certify that it was grown on their own land. This could take weeks. And sometimes the officers demand bribes. Then the government procurement agency has to verify it too. Next, the agency appoints an `expert' to conduct a `pepper vine census' on the farmer's land.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Only farmers with two hectares or less will get help. And only those who have got no government aid in four years. Which rules out the families of those who committed suicide in despair! It would be far simpler to check the imports at the port of entry than to try and police thousands of farms. But this is the system now in place.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"It's a mess,\" says Mr. Veerendrakumar. \"The government's approach has failed totally.\" He points to the need for \"geographical indicators,\" which would specify where the pepper is from. And \"the regulation of imports. This re-mixing of Wayanad pepper with low quality stuff is ruining our export markets.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Wayanad, the King of Spices is now a pauper. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>

Devasia of Pulpally took his own life last week, he was upset because he could not raise the money for his daughter's marriage. The 48-year-old farmer was also the first victim of the government's new rules of pepper sale. These require a lengthy and intrusive process. One that makes it very hard for the farmer to sell his own produce without entering a bureaucratic maze that could tie him down for weeks.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet Devasia's act of despair reflects a growing problem in Wayanad. The number of weddings has fallen sharply. In this crisis-hit district, many are simply unable to afford them.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"People are not willing to send their daughters to Pulpally,\" K.C. Chacko told us. \"Earlier they were eager to.\" Mr. Chacko is retired principal of St. Mary's Higher Secondary School. \"This was once the most prosperous area,\" he says. \"Now it is in the doldrums.\" At the St. Mary's Church \u0097  the biggest in Pulpally \u0097  Fr. Jose Mundakal says that \"weddings are down almost 50 per cent as compared to five years ago.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Kabinigiri, Chinamma Jose explains why. Her husband E.T. Jose was one among 150 or more farmers who committed suicide in 2004. \"He could not complete the house we were building. Now I don't know what to do. It is time for my daughter (aged 23) to get married but where's the money? We ran a teashop for a long time. That folded as people had no more to spend and stopped coming.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNo takers for agriculture\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I'd sell what remaining land we have \u0097  70 cents. But there are no buyers. Who will touch agriculture now? We had more land, but sold off an acre four years ago when the troubles began. Just one month before he died, my husband sold off another 35 cents. It raised very little cash. When pepper and coffee prices collapsed, we even leased some land for growing paddy. But earned nothing. It seems the only option is to keep my girl studying until I build that house. No one will marry her till it is complete.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat tends to be the story in many farm households. Daughters' weddings on hold. It's a painful issue for people to talk about. But some face up to it. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nMarriages delayed\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt St. Sebastian's Church in Mullankoly, Fr. George Alukka and some of his parishioners confirm the problem. \"There are now three to four year delays in many weddings.\" Girls here normally wed around age 20-22, \"but now there are some unmarried at 30.\" The agrarian crisis gripping this district is having a profound impact on the institution of marriage.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"People have even tried offering land as dowry,\" says farmer K.M. Thomas, \"but the bridegrooms don't want it.\" Dowry problems and pressures are now intense. To the extent of creating serious stress for the brides, says Fr. A.K. Varghese, Vicar of the St. George Orthodox Church in Padichira.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This gets worse where there are more girls in the family. The burden of expenses is in itself hard to bear. But problems of status also creep in.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Say, the first girl got married four years ago. The family might have given Rs. 5 lakhs in dowry. Now, for the second girl, they perhaps cannot afford even Rs. 20,000. The first girl has married into a household of higher economic status. The second into a much poorer family. To be honest, it can create serious tensions. Besides, there are now many girls above 25, even 30, with no one to marry. It brings huge imbalances, within and between families. Parents' ties with their children can also suffer.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFr. Baby Elias of the Mar Basil Church in Cheeyambam also confirms that weddings are down. \"In our parish, we would expect 12-18 weddings each year,\" he says. \"Last year, there were only five.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nCatering hit\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, the effect of what is for many an unwritten moratorium on marriages is clear in related fields, too. \"Catering for weddings is down by at least 30 per cent for us. Others too, have been hit,\" says C.H. Balan. He is proprietor of Hotel Kalpaka, one of Sultan Bathery's most famous eating places. \"But the damage goes beyond that. Not only are orders for wedding dinners down, the number of items people ask for when placing such orders is far less than it was four years ago. We are also losing money because gas, electricity, provisions  -   everything is more expensive now.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut Mr. Balan is trapped. He cannot offset this by hiking prices even in his popular eating joint. \"People don't have money. This crisis and price crash means they cannot afford what they earlier used to. Our own costs are up but I cannot raise the price list on my menu. All I've done is to charge one rupee more for full meals. The number of people eating at the deluxe section of this restaurant has fallen. The number of tourists and visiting merchants has dropped sharply. We're hit in more ways than one.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\n`Cultural transition'\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"There is also a big cultural transition,\" says Fr. George Vettikatil. He is Procurator at the Catholic Bishop's House in Sultan Bathery. \"Earlier, the whole neighbourhood helped with a wedding. The people next door brought chairs, food and other help. But the past decade has seen that change. It got very commercial. And weddings came to depend on individual family expenditure rather than on community effort. That loss of community now hurts in the time of crisis.\" And the more commercial it gets, the more it hurts.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

People crowd around, anxious to get their main meal of the day. Many hope to eat and then rush out in the desperate search for work. Quite a few households lie locked up, their residents having left the village. A large group of migrants has just returned from Mumbai, which includes a few <i>joginis</i> who had worked at a construction site there. Not far from them, runs an optic fibre cable. A symbol of \"hi-tech\" progress in Andhra Pradesh.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAt this point, it's not the cable that has the crowd's attention. But something else. \"We don't know who has set this up,\" says one of the <i>joginis</i>.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"But it's a great help to us.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This\" is a gruel centre feeding the hungry. Just one among over 200 such centres spread across Mahbubnagar and Anantapur. But unique in a sense. It's been set up by an independent group of young journalists and academics.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe optic cable is not far from where the gruel queues collect. A powerful new technology running through some of the district's oldest problems. The young group of journalists we're meeting here belongs, physically, to the world of the new technology. But they're making a sensitive effort to connect with the older world of hunger and deprivation.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Hyderabad-based group of journalists and academics have raised and spent tens of thousands of rupees on the three centres they've set up. The core group consists of journalists from <i>The Hindu</i>, <i>The Times of India</i>, freelancers and academics from the Hyderabad Central University.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Gurrakonda, Sarnamma prepares the gruel. She's got three daughters and a son and lives on a widow's pension of Rs. 75 a month. These days she does somewhat better, getting a daily wage to cook the <i>ganji</i> for the poor in this village. Sarnamma needs that gruel as much as any one of the over 200 people she ladles it out to. This centre, too, is funded by the group of journalists.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Anyone who wishes to join us can do so,\" one of them told me in Kondapur.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHe's a founder member of the `Citizen's Collective', as the group calls itself. \"It's open to all. We were appalled at the extent of hunger among villagers at this time. We wanted to do something about it. And were inspired by some of our seniors.\" This includes two well-known journalists in Chennai \"who encouraged us to launch off\". \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We are not an NGO,\" he says. \"There is no corporate, government or institutional donor funding. We have sought none. We're working journalists and cannot run a structured system beyond our work. There's no overheads, no receipts, no paperwork here. Hence, we only approached those we knew personally, for funds.\" He stresses that though most of them are journalists, the academics are a vital part of the core group.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe collective is run on a transparent, non-partisan basis. Yet, \"we do acknowledge that we've taken help from those already in the field. We've never set up a gruel centre before!\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"When does the centre close?\" asks Sarnamma in Gurrakonda. \"When the gruel runs out. Then we think of the next day.\" As she speaks, a number of children show up carrying more than one vessel. There are some men who do not wish to stand in line. They see it as an affront to their dignity. And so, says Ramulu of the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Workers Union in this district, \"they send the children instead. This makes calculating the numbers a little complex. If you watch these kids, you'll see them handing over much of that gruel to the adults at home.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p>                                                \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMost of those making contributions to the centre will not get to see what's happening here, but their money is working well. It costs around Rs. 10,000 for each centre to give 200 people gruel for a month. The collective has already kept two centres running for close to 50 days. Now it has just set up a third.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHow did it begin? \"I think meeting up informally at the Asian Social Forum (in Hyderabad in January 2003) was a starting point,\" says Uma Maheshwari. She's a freelance journalist and a member of the collective. \"Maybe we were not yet a group then. But soon we began to meet on issues like opposing the Iraq war and on communal violence.\" And the beginnings of a group began to take shape.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNewspaper reports and their own findings gave them a feel of what was going on. \"The Indian language press seems far ahead in covering these issues,\" she says. \"We felt we had to respond to the distress.\" Fellow journalists from other publications too, did respond when approached. Friends from <i>Eenadu</i>, <i>Newstime</i>, the <i>New Indian Express </i>and elsewhere.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nQuite a few employees of The <i>Times of India </i>and <i>The Hindu </i>gave hundreds of rupees each. Journalists do not earn great salaries. Yet, one or two gave sums as high as Rs. 5,000. \"These included people who differ with our views on a lot of things,\" says Aniket Alam, a journalist with <i>The Hindu</i>, Hyderabad. He too is a part of the collective. \"Even people we do not know so well, responded generously.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMedia persons from other cities also sent in money. So did alumni of the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, and others. As word got around by e-mail, more contributions came in, including one of Rs. 5,000 from a woman in Chennai. Her son in Hong Kong had heard of the group and asked her to send in his contribution.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"But all the contacting was done on a personal basis. Not on organisational lines.\" And they tried to focus on Mahbubnagar where hunger has gripped the old and the very young left behind as lakhs migrated.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThey could not have chosen a better place. Inequality, always a feature of this region, has deepened sharply this past decade. And with it, hunger and despair. New forms of bondage have been added to the old ones. Take Chinnaiah for instance. He's first in the queue at Gurrakonda. A potter by caste, he cannot afford to continue his craft. The agriculture crisis has destroyed the old barter system he had with his regular clients. He gave them pots, they gave him grain. Now the farmers have no grain to give him in return for his pots. But his obligations within the village remain. Tradition requires him to give two free vessels to each village wedding. \"So now I buy the pots,\" he laughs. \"I am paying for my own traditional work.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe plight of people here may not have moved the State Government. But it has touched the idealism of others. The collective is not the only group in the field. The Telugu daily, <i>Prajashakti</i>, has been running two centres since early March. It too, has been overwhelmed by the response. For instance in Kanimetta village of Kothakota <i>mandal</i> where the older people are quite desperate.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe way some individuals have acted in the face of public distress has also been striking. Circle Inspector M. Narayana of Kothakota <i>mandal</i> is a tough, no-nonsense policeman. But he was amongst the first to come forward and aid the gruel centres that sprang up in his zone.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"What made you donate a quintal of <i>ragi </i>to a gruel centre?\" we asked him. \"I come from a poor family myself and know what hunger is. My family are small farmers in Nizamabad. In Mahbubnagar, lots of people have migrated. Even if there is some agriculture, many of those left behind are too old to till the field or other rigorous work. I felt it was my duty to help.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The rule seems to be that if members of the public get to know what's happening, they do want to help,\" says an assistant at a gruel centre here.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn short, if the media do their job, the public will respond.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany centres might pause or stop operations by early July. Things could slow down a bit from mid-June onwards. To some extent that depends on the rains and the return of migrants for the sowing operations. Yet, even for those that continue or resume after a break, the issues don't end there. As one long time activist puts it: \"There is always the risk of being trapped in a relief mode.\" The problems of this region lie too deep to be banished by these centres. No matter who funds them. However, in the face of immediate hunger, they matter a great deal to those going to them. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe structural inequities of this region run much thicker than the gruel. Yet the idealism that sparked these ventures does more than just fill hungry stomachs for the months of May and June. It inspires others by its unselfish example and holds out hope of even more effective public action in days to come. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>Note: Those wishing to help with the Citizens Collective gruel centre or related activity may write to:\r\n</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n <i><a href=\"mailto:aniketalam@rediffmail.com\">aniketalam@rediffmail.com</a>\r\n</i></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>(Concluded)\r\n</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>The first part of this article appeared in </i>The Hindu, Sunday Magazine, <i>issue dated June 15, 2003.\r\n</i></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n<i>P.

Four million of them in just two districts: Mahbubnagar and Anantapur. The gruel centres (over 200 of them) have been catering to maybe 300 people a day; a process that began in early March. The numbers of both, the centres, and those visiting them, is only growing. There are now 100 more in other districts of the State. The high levels of rural distress are plain to see. Not a single centre, though, was set up or is being run by the State Government.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTAMPER with the recipe and you change the product.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRecipe 1: Take 10 kilograms of <i>ragi</i>. Mix with 40 litres of water. A tad of salt helps. If you're doing this in Mahbubnagar, add two or three kg of <i>nokalu</i> (broken rice). If you're in Anantapur, hold the rice. Shove in six kg of <i>bellam</i> (jaggery) instead. It suits the local palate better. Stir firmly. Bring the whole thing to a boil. What you've got now is <i>ganji </i>or gruel. It won't win you too many cookery contests, but it's nutritious. Lots of poor people survive on it during the lean days.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRecipe 2: Set up a centre in a public place where the poor in a village can access the gruel. What you've got now is lots of hungry people turning up to eat it. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRecipe 3: Toss in political movements. Garnish with the organising skills of the Left parties. Gruel centres now spring up all across two of the hungriest of A.P.'s districts. Drawing thousands of people each day. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYou don't have to stir it any more. Things will come to a boil, anyway. What you've got now is one very angry government of A.P. One claiming all along that its food-for-work programme was doing just fine. One that has refused to open a single such centre of its own. Led by a chief minister held up by the <i>New York Times </i>and <i>The Financial Times </i>as the ideal Third World leader. But seen somewhat differently by a lot of rural poor who do not read those papers, and therefore don't know any better.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhen the first gruel centre came up in March, the Government dismissed it as a \"political gimmick\". This, after all, is the best-run State. Ask the <i>Financial Times</i>, London, which says (May 2) that A.P. is on the verge of a \"social revolution\". One \"sponsored\" by the government, no less.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAsk A.P. Information Minister Somireddy Chandra Mohan Reddy. \"Who in Andhra Pradesh drinks <i>ganji</i>?\" he mocked. Every day tens of thousands of people provide him the answer every day. They do. Every day, 200-300 people \u0097  sometimes more \u0097  visit such centres in the villages where they exist. In some that I went to, the <i>sarpanch</i> was amongst those lining up for gruel to be served.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMigrations have risen steeply in Mahbubnagar. Lakhs have left the district in search of work. That's left large numbers of old people at home, badly undernourished. They and some children are the main visitors at the gruel centres. With the collapse of agriculture, with no work, declining purchasing power, falling food intake, rising debt and growing health problems, distress levels are very high. \"People are so insecure,\" says Saianna in Kondapur, \"they keep some for the night as well. That's how much they need it.\" He's right. Passable at best while hot, the gruel tastes awful when cold and dry at night. \"Like rubber,\" as he puts it.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Communist Party of India (CPI-M) sparked it off in March, launching the first centre in Mahbubnagar. The aim seems to have been to deal at some level with acute hunger in the villages. To force the Government to do the same. And to put pressure on the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu to take up food for work programmes seriously. Even ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) officials squirm in defending the Government's food programme, flawed in policy and riddled with corruption at it is.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nCongress (I) leader Y.S. Rajashekar Reddy has zeroed in on the failure of the food for work agenda. In his <i>padayatra</i> in two regions of the State, Reddy made it a centre piece of his anti-TDP campaign. Yet, the Congress (I) has been cautious in opening gruel centres itself. It seems worried about the implications. It had opened six in Mahbubnagar by end-April, while promising 50. By that time, the Left parties, independent groups and religious trusts had set up 70. Now that number has grown. The CPI and allied groups are running 174 centres in both districts. Local leaders of the TDP clearly feel the heat. The public approves of the centres. On the other hand, annoying Naidu is a shortcut to oblivion in the TDP. Meanwhile, the food-for-work programme remains a mess.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The cost of rice for below poverty line families on the public distribution system is Rs. 5.25,\" points out Saianna. \"But on the food-for-work scheme, they change that. They treat the cost of each kilogramme as Rs. 8. For exactly the same rice! That way they pay us a lot less.\" In some places this has sparked off agitations demanding cash for work, not food.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat began modestly with a single gruel centre in Gundalapalli on March 6, mushroomed swiftly. The rate of spread of new centres has been an embarrassment to the Government. There are now over 200 in the two districts. And 100 in others. Not even one of them is run by the administration. All are based on donations from the public. \"Maybe 65 per cent of this village has turned migrant,\" Chennaiah, tells us in Kanimetta village of the Kothakota <i>mandal</i>. \"Our people have gone to Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Orissa, Delhi, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu looking for work.\" But the many old people left behind face hunger. And the gruel centre is their gathering point. The Kanimetta centre is one of two run by the Telugu daily, <i>Prajashakti</i>. Close to 20 are run by the Jan Vigyan Vedika (Peoples Education Forum) or JVV. The casual efficiency of these centres is in stark contrast to official apathy.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe organisers keep them open for hours until the huge vessels are empty. A shorter duration would mean longer queues. This way, it allows people to drift in at a more measured pace. Sometimes, however, the pressure still mounts.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"In one Anantapur village, people asked for the centre to open at 2 p.m.,\" says Dr. Gehanand, a popular medical practitioner. He is associated with the JVV. \"After some days, they told us to shift the timing to 11 a.m. The reason? People who had gone for whatever little work they could get, were coming back by 2 p.m. and competing with the rest for the gruel. That's how hungry people are. And there are so many.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe health of people in the villages is worsening,\" says Dr. Gehanand. \"They are eating less. Their resistance to disease is less. At least one person in every village household has been visited by malaria. At least once in the last two years. And that's a conservative estimate. It shows in other ways, too. The general immunity of the population seems to have gone down.\" The pressure the centres exert has been both moral and political. As word of the hunger in the countryside gets around, people are becoming generous. The last thing the CPI-M expected, for instance, was a phone call from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) State President G. Pulla Reddy. But it happened. Reddy contributed Rs. 50,116 to be used for the gruel centres run by the leftists. The pressure on TDP functionaries has been enormous.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome have broken ranks and gone one up. In Anantapur, TDP <i>zilla parishad </i>chief Jorna Suryanarayana is running a \"lunch centre\". And he has been most generous. A full meal is served to around 2,500 people each day. And he intends to keep this going for 100 days. It might not please Chandrababu Naidu. But it does the <i>zilla parishad </i>chief no harm locally. Besides, he's been smart about it. Since it's based in a big temple at Kadiri, it seems less an act of politics than one of devotion. Held elsewhere, it might be seen as competing with the gruel centres.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p>                                                \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFurther, doing it here gives him free or cheap access to water and the temple's space. Hosting 2,500 people anywhere else would be mighty difficult.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nQuite a few TDP and Congress (I) leaders have been donating quietly to Left-run gruel centres. \"It's unique,\" laughs a local journalist. \"At least this crisis has brought some people from these warring forces together. Maybe silently and on the sly, but it's happening. After all, anyone who has eyes can see the hunger.\" Anyone, that is, except the State Government.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, some of the privately run \"lunch centres\" \u0097  and there are now a few \u0097  show signs of their contractor links. At one, we saw rice that had clearly come from the food-for-work programme. Rice that should have gone directly to the poor. The organiser, a local big wig, had also bought hundreds of shiny and new stainless steel plates to serve that rice. \"He figured out that it would cost more to rent them than to just buy and resell them after a few days,\" laughs a local journalist.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut the biggest bash came from Naidu himself. One place where hunger was banished for three days in May was Tirupati. The TDP's \"Mahanadu\" conference drew over 6,000 delegates and a few thousand others. \"The food alone cost over Rs. 30 lakhs,\" said a journalist returning from there. \"The buttermilk packets came from `Heritage Foods', a company run by the Chief Minister's wife. Mr. Chandrababu Naidu announced a huge package of measures aimed at farmers. Yet, he had all along denied hunger and starvation. And frowned on gruel centres.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith Rs. 30 lakhs, you can run 300 gruel centres for a month. Together serving 27 million portions of gruel in that time.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome TDP activists, unable to defy their leader and start centres, have tried a new tack. They tell people that they are getting this gruel because of the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu. That he ordered the Government to set up the centres. Since the real organisers of the centres have done very little self-publicity, this is a smart idea. You might even get away with it. We did find some in the villages who believed it. Who says there's no such thing as a free lunch? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>(To be continued)\r\n</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\nP.

It's the bus to Mumbai and its 58 seats will be more than full. Perhaps at the starting point itself. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's a temperature at which you hate everybody and arguments driven by colourful prose ring out in the bus depot (and on the buses). The travellers, like lakhs of others in this poorest of Andhra Pradesh's districts, are voting with their feet. Most of them are tiny farmers and landless workers. The biggest group consists of Lambada adivasis. There are many poor dalits too. All getting out of a situation they find intolerable. In some estimates, close to a third of the district's populace could be working outside it just now.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince they're doing so in May, the clich\u00e9 of drought presents itself at once. The problem with that notion is that an even larger number of people migrate from here in the period from November to January.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are three unusual passengers on the Mumbai bus today. Ramulu, Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Workers Union in this district. Venugopal, a reporter with <i>Prajashakti</i>, a Telugu daily. And yours truly. This way, the travellers are our captives. For some hours, anyway. Now we can check if they are \"fleeing the drought\" that's believed to be the sole cause of distress here.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhy check? And why Mahbubnagar? Because it's less than a hundred kilometres from the State capital. Which is where the country's most celebrated chief minister sits. The crisis in the State's agriculture \u0097  and governance \u0097  is real. It has gripped this district for some time now. But with a national media reluctant to see that Andhra Pradesh is somewhat bigger than Hyderabad, Mr. Naidu's policies have not faced the scrutiny they deserve. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe extent of the distress-driven exodus is not agreed on, though. \"There have been migrations from Mahbubnagar for a long time,\" says District Collector Madhusudhan Rao. And in that sense, he's right. However, he sees no reason to conclude that they have been much worse this season. In fact, \"more work and grain is reaching the villages in this period\".\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAre migrations no greater, really?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhen I tried making it to Mumbai from here in 1993, I was told then there was one bus from the region weekly. Today, there are 32 to 34 buses a week going straight to Mumbai from here. If the two more routes the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation is planning come through, that number could cross 45 buses weekly. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThen there are the private bus services to Mumbai. And tens of thousands also take the trains each season. More have done so this year. All three trains going to Mumbai via Thandur are running full every day. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"About 65 per cent of this village has gone out looking for work on those buses,\" Chennaiah had laughed. That was in Kanimetta village of the Kothakota <i>mandal</i> the day before. He himself was a low-level labour recruiter. \"That route to Mumbai is our lifeline.\" \"Mumbai\" really means several stops in Maharashtra, including Pune and Thane. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPeople are leaving Mahbubnagar in very large numbers. Many do so each year, anyway, as the Collector points out. But the flow has been getting worse in recent years And it's certainly heavier in this one. \r\n</p> <p>7\r\nA large part of the RTC's revenue here comes from the Mumbai route. And it's clear that there are often over 100 passengers on those 58-seat buses. Which means some people are standing for much of that 18-hour journey. And then there are the huge numbers from this district heading for Hyderabad. Also, to at least 30 other destinations ranging from Gujarat to Rajasthan, even Orissa. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat accounts for this desperate out-migration? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Without Mumbai and Pune, we cannot survive,\" says Pandu Nayak, a Lambada adivasi. In Perkiveed <i>tanda </i>(colony) of the Koilkonda <i>mandal </i>where he's from, \"Our households are deep in debt. Our children, starving\". Venkataiah, from the same <i>tanda </i>adds: \"Any chance of agriculture here is finished. The costs are simply too high. If you are a labourer, it's worse. In a month, you cannot find more than three or four days of work. All this makes life too hard. And now there is no water either. The government does nothing.\" (\"Venkataiah\" is not at all a typical Lambada name. But many in that community adopt such \"mainstream\" names when they venture out. Letting people know you're an adivasi is asking to be exploited.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat he's telling us pretty much matches with what we've already seen. In the villages of Gurrakonda, Kondapur or Vepur, for instance. People here are in deep distress. What little work there is, is in the hands of contractors who have cornered government projects. They prefer labourers from outside as such a group would be more submissive. Hence, not many from the district can find work here. Mahbubnagar's workers have been the backbone of some of the toughest construction projects in dozens of cities in other States. There, their labour is sought after. Here, they are kept idle. However, the same contractors of Telangana will use thousands of these men and women in Rajasthan or Orissa. Cut off and alone in those States, they are more dependent and pliant. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nCountless households lie locked up. Thousands of others have just the oldest member of the family left behind. The mass migrations destroy any chance of education for the children who accompany their parents for months at a time. (This is A.P.'s worst district in terms of literacy.) While agriculture has done badly countrywide, it has sunk in this State. And that for some time now. Growth in agriculture last year was minus 17.06 per cent. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd it wasn't just the drought. Mahbubnagar has done badly in good monsoon years, too. Other States have faced worse droughts without agriculture caving in to the extent it has in Andhra Pradesh. Often, too, migrants are leaving from relatively water surplus regions of the State. The country has seen many policies hostile to small farmers and landless workers this past decade. But here, they've been extra harsh. This State leads in farmers' suicides. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere's a steely ruthlessness towards the rural poor. The year 2001 saw rice exported to overseas markets at Rs. 5.45 a kilogram. It was a time of widespread hunger and distress. Yet, the State sold rice to its own poor at Rs. 6.40 a kg. Some of the \"exports\" were rejected as \"unfit for humans\". It was after this that food-for-work programmes began here in that season. Huge power tariff hikes, soaring input costs, fake pesticides, all these brought small farmers to their knees. Massive corruption in the food-for-work-programme hasn't helped either. It's all added up to an awful crisis. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p>                                                \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDebt-driven small farmers and landless workers have left this district in larger numbers this season. About two lakh people migrating seasonally has never been seen as an issue. The estimates of those on the move now vary vastly. From six lakhs to eight to 10 lakhs, according to claims in the Telugu press. Where they are going, there is at least better money. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Yes, we earn more in Mumbai than here,\" says Venkataiah. \"But the moment we are back we have to pay our creditors much of what we save.\" He could earn up to Rs. 250 in a single day in Mumbai as a carpenter. And he finds work on \"maybe 15 days in a month. Twenty if I'm lucky\". However \"don't forget our loans here\", he says. That lands them in an unending trap. Every single person going to Mumbai is also in debt. \"Whatever we earn in Mumbai, most of that goes in repaying our loans.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWe are on the road to Mumbai. Even as we sit in different parts of the bus, speaking to migrants, drivers Fashiuddin and Sattar prove a mine of information. They've done this route many times and know their passengers. Fashiuddin gives us a virtual disaster tour. He points to streams that have died, tanks that have dried. The lack of repairs to tanks and canals. The devastated fields, the impossibility of keeping your farm running. \"These are really hard working people, sir. But who cares for them? They cannot find work here. There is nothing done to give them employment. They are poor and in debt. On top of all of that comes the drought.\" He's clear that there is a significant man-made element to the crisis. \"If only there was an attempt to give them some work,\" he says. \"That's why they go to Mumbai,\" he adds. \"Most of them will go and work in building construction, brick making and roads.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPatterns change according to where more construction is taking place. \"Eighty per cent of this bus will empty at Pune,\" predicts Sattar. He's speaking as he helps a young woman with a two-month old baby board the bus at a stop. There's a delay, with several tearful family farewells enacted at the same time. Sattar mixes sympathy with an ability to plug the farewell routines swiftly.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOur surprise find on board is M. Ganesh, a 20-year-old student. A Telugu whose family is in Mahbubnagar, he studies in Mumbai and stays there with his brother. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nGanesh is proud to be a card-carrying Shiv Sainik. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHe is a bit bewildered when we ask him about Sena chief Thackeray's latest call for ridding Mumbai of \"outsiders\", especially poor ones landing up in the metro seeking work. \"I've heard nothing about this,\" he says. \"I've been away. But I will enquire about it when I get there.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn their destination towns, the migrants will live in appalling conditions. On the street, in soul-breaking slums or, at best, in filthy <i>chawls</i>. \"Still, it's better than going hungry here,\" says Nagesh Goud on the bus. \"At least we earn something.\" Increasingly, a large part of that something gets chewed up in medical costs. One of the biggest problems faced by the district's poor workers is rising health expenses. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEvery migrant you speak to confirms he or she has had more than one episode of <i>jaram </i>(fever). \"A visit to a doctor in Mumbai could cost between Rs. 40 to Rs. 100,\" says Nagesh. \"That's not counting the medicines.\" The children fall ill very often. Most people cannot cope with the medical costs. And many have taken ailments from the cities back home to their villages. The general immunity of a population that's undernourished and overworked seems to be in decline. Yet, many more venture out to evade hunger and misery.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith a population of some 34 lakhs and perhaps close to a third of that ending up outside, Mahbubnagar is in big trouble. Some other districts, too, face similar hardships. Software is not the only thing A.P. exports. Nor hi-tech brains to the United States. Misery-driven migrations, hunger, and distress are among its other major products. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>P.

That's against just about one a week, a decade ago. People are leaving in the droves. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDrought? Mahbubnagar does have a problem. Quite a bit of that, though, is about the control, distribution and the use of water. At 634 mm, the average rainfall of the last 14 years here is close to 30 mm above normal. The official figures, at least. There have been deficit years. And a couple of truly awful ones \u0097  as in a lot of other districts. This year, district Collector Madhusudhan Rao says, \"the deficit is eight per cent so far\". Unpleasant, but not crushing.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHowever, it hurts a lot more when that comes among the many other problems Mahbubnagar has. Problems that are not seasonal. For instance, a social backwardness that has lakhs of people in bondage. (This is a district where some workers still have to present their landlord with a pair of sandals each year, and where teashops routinely use separate glasses for dalits and upper caste customers when serving beverages.) Our bus has more than a few dalit passengers. None of them can enter the temples in their villages. Forget about having their weddings in them.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOr take the issue of debt. Every migrant on our bus is steeped in it. \"We'll be paying that forever,\" says Venkataiah, a Lambada adivasi, with a rueful smile. \"How can we ever make it up?\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe huge lack of employment in the district hits everything. Even the women's self help groups (SHGs) at the village level. \"Each member is to deposit one rupee daily from her earnings into the group fund,\" Subhadramma had told us in Vepur. \"In theory that's fine,\" this landless worker had said. \"One rupee a day, 30 days, Rs. 30. But when we earn only Rs.12 or Rs.15 a day, that single rupee counts. So what happens when we find work for less than 10 days in a month?\" What happens is that the self help group flounders, especially with many members migrating \u0097  and several others borrowing to make their payments and their spouses running up other debts.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's a district where mass migrations have destroyed the chance of large numbers of children becoming literate, let alone getting an education. \"Of course we take the small ones and go,\" Sarnamma had told us in Gurrakonda village. \"How can we leave them behind?\" With their parents on the move for up to nine months a year, these children will end up becoming an army of hard-core illiterates. Their chances of climbing out of poverty, devastated. Every family on the bus has at least one very small child with it. Often more.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt's a district where a small group of powerful feudals controls most resources. Including water. The shortages of water for the poor often arise from this control. Unequal sharing further shatters the small farms. Even if they are not big \"droughts\" in an absolute sense, these shortages cause huge damage. They certainly lead to even more out-migration.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDevelopment here has often been based on strategies that have boomeranged. May be on plans once aimed at a more prosperous section that have also caught on down the line. With the poor imitating the rich. Every small farmer you meet has spent a fortune on borewells. \"That is a major cost,\" Chandraiah, a farmer had told us in Gurrakonda. He still thinks it's a good idea to sink more. \"Yes, that has been a big route to debt,\" he adds.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe focus here has rarely been on equity or on a fair deal for the poor. In water, it's been more about extraction, as Collector Madhusudhan Rao's figures show: \"In the mid-1980s, the district had 97 per cent open (or traditional) wells and just three per cent borewells. By 2001-02, that figure had been reversed. Now it was 97 per cent borewells and three per cent open wells.\" Desperation has also led to the borewells being sunk deeper. Debt has swollen with their number.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nInequality, always a feature of this region, has widened sharply this past decade. And with it, despair. New forms of bondage have emerged. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nQuite a bit of these find reflection in the labour-contract systems. And in the migrations themselves. Many of those on the bus to Mumbai are in the clutches of contractors. Here in Mahbubnagar, and also often in those towns outside the State where they seek work. The old Palamuuru contract labour system, as it is called, is quite alive. But it's also gained new features.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p>                                                \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are over one million human beings from here who have, at some point in their lives, worked outside Mahbubnagar. All have tasted the contractor raj that runs the district. And that is an extensive many-layered system. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLarge contractors do not directly hire labour. \"They first farm out chunks of their projects to others,\" says Ramulu of the Agricultural Workers Union. \"For instance, if your clout has landed you a canal contract, you give out some kilometres of work on it to different sub-contractors. The sub-contractors then contact the <i>gumpu maistrys</i> or group labour contractors. These are men who have within their control several team leaders or <i>maistrys</i> who can bring dozens \u0097  some times even hundreds \u0097  of workers to them. Each of these <i>maistrys</i> is capable of raising teams of workers from different villages.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Each team has a <i>panni maistry</i>, or work leader who acts as a sort of disciplinarian. What the contractors do is to pay an advance to the <i>gumpu maistry</i>. He in turn gives out some of this to the regular <i>maistrys</i>, and so on down the line. Finally, a small part of the money goes to the workers who make the journey to Mumbai or elsewhere.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe workers might get a small advance ranging from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 10,000. That's a fraction of what the middlemen get down the line. The <i>maistry</i> recruiting in Kanimetta village could have got Rs. 20 to Rs. 40,000. The <i>gumpu maistry</i> above him, a lot more. But that small advance at the bottom binds the debt-strapped workers. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIf they're doing hard labour in another part of the State or within Mahbubnagar itself, they haven't a hope of getting the minimum wage. Already, at the Jurala canal lining works, we've met some earning less than Rs. 45 where the wage ought to be Rs. 83. If they're going outside the State to Mumbai, they would earn much more. But a lot of that will disappear on their return. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We have to pay up a good bit to our local creditors,\" says Venkataiah. \"That is, if they are to allow us to live in any degree of peace in the village.\" Often the principal sum has been repaid many times over. But the exorbitant interest rates \u0097  60 per cent or higher \u0097  keep them in debt. At least two-thirds of what he earns in Mumbai goes in debt repayment on his return. Besides, he's spent a lot on health and other expenses in Mumbai. Venkataiah, at least, goes out as a carpenter. And yet he's left with almost nothing. The less skilled ones have it much worse.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe contractor fraternity has worked out an effective system that delivers for it. This accounts, in part, for the large numbers of people on the 34 buses that leave the region every day. The system has a simple rule. Never use local labour if you can help it, no matter how good they are. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Local labour tends to go to weddings and festivals,\" explains Chandrashekhar Reddy. He is an outspoken and important contractor on the Jurala works project. \"Labour from outside is more easy to discipline. I have workers from Bihar, Orissa and elsewhere. Where this company goes, they go.\" And so, on his canal lining project, you can find workers from these States. Also many from other parts of Andhra Pradesh, like Khammam. But fewer from Mahbubnagar.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs another contractor put it: \"Outside labour does not know the local language. They are more dependent.\" They are thus harder to unionise. They can be put through wretched working conditions without a chance of redress. The press tends to get mobilised, if at all, when the affected workers are local. Those from outside carry little clout. At some of the work sites, then, pregnant women have worked right up to the day of delivery. And resumed work less than 10 days later.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMahbubnagar labour itself goes to at least 30 cities across the country. Fulfilling similar strategies for the same or different contractors over there. \"We've built skyscrapers in Mumbai and apartment blocks in Pune,\" Sailu in Kondapur village had told us. \"But in Mahbubnagar we have no work.\" Madhusudhan Rao lists a series of projects and works that are on in the district. He believes that \"anyone who wants work in Mahbubnagar can find it now.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThose crowding the buses and trains believe otherwise. Employment on the projects is controlled by the contractors to whom they are given. \"They won't pay us anything liveable here,\" says Nagesh Goud.  Nor do the food-for-work programmes, to the extent they exist, fill the need. The long lines at the gruel centres in several villages make that clear. Agriculture has taken a severe beating and not just because of a drought. The rise in the costs of inputs have crushed small farmers. So has the collapse of rural credit. Bus drivers Fashiuddin and Sattar know well how many small farmers travel with them each time they take the route out of Mahbubnagar. \"Farming,\" says Fashiuddin \"is a mess.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Every single cost has gone up,\" Chandraiah, a farmer in Gurrakonda had told us. \"A bag of ammonia phosphate costs three times what it did in 1991. The cost of paddy seed has doubled. That of electricity has risen manifold. Farming has become too difficult.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"With those costs, we need credit. But if you are a small farmer like I am, with two acres, that's impossible,\" Chennaiah in Vepur village had said. \"If we go to the bank, we are turned away. But the bigger landowners are well connected. My request for Rs. 20,000 will be turned down. The landlord, however will get, say, Rs. 60,000. He uses what he needs of it. Then he loans me that Rs. 20,000 \u0097  at a rate of interest much higher than that of the bank.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere's a constant propaganda, however, that leaves quite a few villagers believing the rains, new irrigation schemes and relief works could end  their problems. It's a claim forever drummed in by many, from the MP and MLAs and local politicians down to the village elite. Because that line results in projects. And projects result in contracts. And contracts result in money for the right people.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSure, the water shortage hits the poor. But Mahbubnagar's distress is a complex mesh. It rests on one of the most oppressive and structured systems of labour exploitation. On its complicated contractor-<i>maistry</i> mafia. It feeds on the death of small farms driven by the policies of the last 12 years. On the crisis of agriculture itself in the region. It is fuelled by the social backwardness of centuries. And driven by the dismal human development record of the past decade. The lack of employment spurs the mass human migrations that so debilitate the district.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"What are all those provisions doing on your dashboard?\" I ask bus driver Fashiuddin as we get off. \"Oh those,\" he smiles. \"We'll do our own cooking when we get to the Kurla bus depot in Mumbai. I like Maharashtra \u0097  but their food! They don't use any chilli at all unlike in our meals at home. So we take all our stuff and cook it there.

The indebted farmer committed suicide in April this year. But officialdom has not noticed. Everyone else has, though, in his village of Neradacheruvu in Mahbubnagar district. Well, almost everyone. The panchayat seems to have taken no action on behalf of his family. And they may get no help.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAndhra Pradesh has a new Government. But it also has its old bureaucracy. One that acts just as it did for years. With striking lack of concern on the farmers' suicides. So the proper count of their number and nature is proving chaotic. Many affected households have been recorded wrongly or not at all. But if that was to be expected of the State machinery, whatever happened to the panchayats?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Janmabhoomi happened,\" says young K. Jangaiah. He is sarpanch of Shabuddlapur in Nalgonda district. \"Janmabhoomi\" was the flagship project of the Naidu Government. One seen as a whole new \"model of development.\" It aimed, among many other things, \"to involve people in the implementation of development programmes.\" In theory, at least.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"In practice,\" says Chandra Mohan Reddy in Mahbubnagar district, \"a huge parallel structure emerged. One that simply bypassed people and crippled panchayati raj in this State.\" Mr. Reddy was sarpanch of Midgil in this district for about 13 years. \"The gram sabha, gram panchayat, none of these had any meaning. The show was run by bureaucrats.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAndhra Pradesh could well be the biggest violator of the 73rd Amendment of the Indian Constitution. If the panchayats have failed in the ongoing crisis, there is good reason for it. They have had no real power for years now. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"The parallel setup led to a sharp centralisation of power,\" says Mr. Reddy. \"New committees came up at the village level that were not elected by the people as a whole. Only by small groups with vested interests. And who could be managed from above.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nCommittees sprouted in great numbers. Each village had them. These included an education or <i>vidya</i> committee. And, of course, one for watersheds. Also, a <i>ryuthu mitra</i> (farmers' friends) group. \"Forest committees sprang up where no forests existed,\" says Mr. Jangaiah. Then there were also the \"Water Users Associations.\" And Library Committees. Even one for Continuing Education. The <i>Anganwadis</i> were run by \"mothers\" committees.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"Not a single one of these was answerable to the panchayat,\" says Mr. Jangaiah. \"They were run by small cabals, each with a chairman who could control them. But the funds went to them. Not to the elected panchayats who lost all decision-making powers.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn name, these too, were \"elected.\" But by a tiny base. Yet the large funds they got ensured that village elites took over quickly. \"My gram panchayat had a budget of just Rs.13,000,\" says Mr. Jangaiah. The funds poured into the committees by the Government and its foreign donors ran to millions of rupees in many cases. This profusion of bodies drew a positive nod from the World Bank and other backers. This was in Bank jargon, \"facilitating stakeholder consultations.\" Once it bombed, some quietly distanced themselves from the programme. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBattles for control could be intense. Like in Chaudanpally in Nalgonda. Here, \"elections\" to the \"mothers committee\" were postponed four times as rival groups clashed. The total electorate for this poll was all of 55. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn theory, legitimacy flowed from gram sabha to gram panchayat. And from there to the mandal and zilla parishad. Not in Andhra, say the sarpanchas. In all villages, people speak of how that process was gutted. Here, a \"nodal officer\" at the mandal level wielded much power. A bureaucrat, he was appointed by and answered to the Collector. Who, in turn, reported to the Chief Minister. Constitutionally, elected bodies were simply shoved aside. The panchayats were starved of funds. The \"committees\" of the parallel structure were flush with them.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The gram sabha meeting was controlled by the nodal officer,\" says Mr. Jangaiah. \"Not by us. They decided and told us when the gram sabha would be held. And what its agenda would be. We were never consulted. The nodal officer ran the show. The sarpanch sat as a nominal chairman. A mere figurehead. \"Their will prevailed over public opinion.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe impact of the parallel structure was devastating. \"Local democracy died,\" says Chandramohan Reddy in Midgil. \"This system helped the flowering of contractor raj. A percentage raj. In which each vested interest got its cut. Right up to the MLA and MP. Democratic pressure from below could be ignored. The post of chairman of the <i>vidya</i> committee could be as hotly contested \u0097  with a micro-electorate \u0097  as that of the sarpanch! Why? Because of the money involved.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany of Andhra's new contractors blossomed in this soil. More so in villages where education committees received big sums for buildings. Quite a few of those who contested the polls this year had a village <i>vidya</i> committee background. They had the funds to do so. Most, clearly, were with the ruling Telugu Desam Party.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n \"When there is no panchayat,\" says Mr. Reddy, \"there can be no effective collection of rents and rates. No proper keeping of records. No correct monitoring of work. Here, the panchayats could not pay their own salaries. They had no sanitary workers as they could not pay even daily wages.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"So when we have a crisis, they can do very little. The sarpanch was a link with the outside world. That was broken. The gram sabha and gram panchayat were simply stifled. Janmabhoomi was a bureaucrat-driven show. It went through the village like mobile durbar, dishing out favours and patronage.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"People need panchayats,\" says Suravaram Krishna, in Shabuddlapur. \"These committees are not accountable to them. With the panchayat, they can defeat the sarpanch in the next poll. Those rights were taken away from them.\" And it all happened in the name of \"good governance.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe loss of local democracy still has a profound impact on rural Andhra. Neither sarpanch nor ward members have been active in the farm crisis. They have not even been involved in counting the suicides though they are better suited to do so than those now in charge. The demoralisation of the panchayats is all but complete. The State, as Mr. Reddy puts it, needs \"panchayati raj.\" Not a \"percentage raj.\"</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

He was there for days. This family has already lost all its money on hospitals.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nJanreddy died hours after we met him. His daughter-in-law, who became a bonded labourer to keep the family afloat, will remain one till debts of Rs. 5 lakh are paid off. Over Rs. 3 lakh of that was incurred on medical costs. His wife, who donated one kidney to her son \u0097  both of his had collapsed \u0097  does any work she can find. The son, Narsi Reddy, confined to home, has to drink only the purest water in a place where there is none. His medicines cost around a thousand rupees each month.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe huge medical bills of this family of six were incurred despite the son getting free operations at the Osmania Government Hospital in Hyderabad. They had first gone to private hospitals for checkups, a biopsy and other tasks. As the costs mounted they sold off land and cattle to meet them. That Narsi Reddy had sunk four borewells didn't help. All of them failed. Crisis on their four-acre farm in Chelliagudam village of Nalgonda district saw Janreddy's health too, cave in. \"They might just have survived the crop failure,\" say the neighbours, \"but their medical costs destroyed them.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHealth spending is amongst the fastest growing components of rural family debt. More so in Andhra Pradesh. For years, the State boosted the private sector in health, promoted corporate hospitals and pioneered the \"user fees\" system in Government ones.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The Naidu Government dismantled the public health system,\" says M. Geyanand, a leading doctor from Anantapur district. Dr. Geyanand is also State president of the Jana Vignyana Vedika (JVV), a body that aims to promote popular science and the scientific temper. \"Ninety per cent of patients who go to public hospitals are poor. When that system fails them, they turn to private ones at a huge price. Health costs often count for as much as 20 to 25 per cent in the total expenditures of such households. And a single medical emergency can ruin them.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nA common thread running through the farmers' suicides plaguing the State has been very high medical spending. Just five households affected by such deaths had health costs totalling around Rs.4 lakhs. All of them farming families who held between half an acre and three acres of land. (Some of that mortgaged.) Janreddy's family has not seen a suicide. But it fits this profile rather well.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs do countless other poor households. Even last year, we ran into a farmer who had attempted suicide in the Nallamada mandal of Anantapur district. His friends just managed to get him to a hospital in time. The rescued farmer abused his saviours. The reason: the four-day stay and treatment in hospital cost Rs.45,000. \"I tried to commit suicide because I could not pay debts of Rs.1.5 lakh,\" he said bitterly. \"Now I owe even more.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany of those who succeeded in taking their lives this year had huge medical bills. P. Hanumantha Reddy's family in Nizamabad district owes Rs.2 lakhs. The survivors of A. Narasimhalu in Medak have to rustle up Rs.70,000 plus interest. The tab for K. Shivarajaiah's family in the same district is Rs.50,000. All this was money borrowed at absurd rates of interest.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"There is a link between the suicides and the crisis of health in Andhra,\" says Dr. Geyanand. \"The collapse of the public health system is crucial. In any poor villages, you can see people dying of diseases that should not kill them. Malaria is just one example. For years now, all their support systems have been slashed. The costs are so high, they run out of money halfway through treatment. Those who fall ill are selling land, gold, cattle and other assets to pay medical bills. They also take loans they can never repay.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the past decade, the little access the poor had to health sharply declined. So Gunala Kumar discovered when he had to fork out Rs.40,000 in medical costs to private hospitals in Medak. That remains a big chunk in his total debt of over Rs.2 lakhs. A debt that caused him to take his own life in Meerdoddi village this month. Like his father who committed suicide last year.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Maybe it is better to die,\" says Yekalapu Husein of Shabuddlapur in Nalgonda. \"How will we pay the fees they ask us to at these hospitals?\" A toddy tapper who suffered a fall from high in a tree while at work, Mr. Husein has run up huge bills himself. Then came his malnourished wife's illness. His `medical debt' now stands at Rs.2 lakhs. \"Even if we get free care at Osmania Hospital,\" he laughs, \"we do not have money for the bus fare to Hyderabad and back.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn G. Edavalli village in the same district, the local Rural Medical Practitioner sold all his land to pay his own treatment costs of Rs.4 lakhs at a corporate hospital in Hyderabad. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the years these dramas unfolded, public hospitals were starved of funds, medicines and drugs. Given Rs.600 crores by the World Bank for public health, the Naidu government spent this mostly on buildings. Very few doctors or nurses were recruited with it. The buildings now show decay for lack of maintenance. Mr. Naidu also authored a Government `tie-up' with corporate bodies. Under this, employees of the State went to corporate, not public hospitals. The Government reimbursed their costs. This meant a windfall for those hospitals. It also meant many scams in the shape of inflated reimbursement bills. Meanwhile, health institutions in the public sphere suffered.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The introduction of `user fees' made health even less accessible to the poor,\" says a senior IAS officer. The fees have since been withdrawn by the new Government. Also dumped was an idea of handing over some super speciality departments of public hospitals to `private management.' That is, to corporate hospitals.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe damage, though, has been done. The medical costs of those who preferred death to debt still plague the living. We pass Janreddy's wife at the bus stand, looking for any `coolie work' she can find. There are, after all, bills to be paid. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>

It has 130 `Tata Spacios' (air-conditioned) too. And, it's not doing too badly on the `Toyota Qualis' front either \u0097  85 of those are registered here. Nor does it lag behind on the latest. Barely 48 hours after the national launch of the `Mahindra Scorpio', there were six on these roads. There are now 30. Much of the swank stuff has shown up in the last two years. The local road transport authority's records are a gold mine.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere is a modest fleet of `Tata Safaris'. Plus perhaps of `Tata Indicas', `Hyundai Santros' and `Maruti Zens'. And more Mahindra jeeps than you can count. Anantapur town, where these are registered, has a population of just around three lakh people. This startling research from <i>Eenadu</i> (the largest Telugu daily) also shows that many more of these vehicles actually run here, but are registered in Hyderabad and Bangalore. Even counting only those listed locally, this town might have more sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and fancy cars per capita than either of those metros.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAll in all, amazing signs of progress and prosperity.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nExcept that Anantapur is one of the poorest districts in Andhra Pradesh. It is also the most crisis-ridden one in the State, along with Mahbubnagar. Agriculture has collapsed since the mid-1990s. More farmers have committed suicide here than in any other part of the country. Large numbers of people have left the district. Thousands of students have dropped out of school and college in the past three years. Including many who were on scholarships.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAdd to all this, a drought that is biting deep. A genuine one. Against a normal rainfall of 544 mm, the district got 270 mm last year. This year, it has had no rains at all thus far. So where did all those fancy cars \u0097  placing Anantapur in the fast lane \u0097  come from?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>Drought is the great provider.</b>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnantapur's crisis has many causes. But is always reduced to a generic \"drought\". <i>The actual variation in rainfall over the last 125 years is far from dramatic</i>. And the average of 522 mm during 1991-2000 was better than during the previous decade. For 1981-90, the average was just 463 mm. So rainfall in the 1990s was in fact <i>just above the normal of 520 mm</i>. There have been a couple of bad years since then. Including 2001, in which the rains came aplenty \u0097  but too late. Overall, the data does not support the notion of drought as being the eternal villain. Drought just makes an unbearable situation worse.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe district's poverty and structural inequalities are huge. But drought is still offered as the cause of all that goes wrong. Hundreds of crores of rupees have poured into Anantapur in the past five or six years in the name of fighting \"drought\". And now there's a real one, it helps bring in even more funds. This money has rarely translated into jobs for people. Or improved living standards. Or enhanced nutrition and health. It has largely gone into contractor-led \"projects.' And, most recently, into a food-for-work programme that private contractors have got.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p>                                                \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe worse things have become in Anantapur district, the more cars have shown up in Anantapur town.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>Drought, as the organised plunderer of the poor.\r\n</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nContractors, sub-contractors, traders and local politicians own these cars. (Often, that's the same bunch of people). So do bureaucrats and even, oh yes, the non government organisations.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs in all things Indian, there is a caste hierarchy in the cars. The research on the whole issue by <i>Eenadu</i> ace reporter Narasimha Reddy bears this out. He has done more stories on rural distress, farmers' suicides and the misuse of development funds than most journalists in the country. \"The flashy and latest ones are owned by the top contractors,\" he says. \"The `Zens', `Santros' and `Indicas' are mostly the preserve of the bureaucrats.\" The NGOs understandably do best  among the jeeps.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhile the cars colour the town and highway, the villagers move down another road. Tens of thousands visit gruel centres every day to pick up what will be their main, if not only, meal. A helping of gruel made from <i>ragi</i>, water, a little salt and jaggery. Thousands more battle to save their tiny farms from money lenders.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd  thousands more stand in desperate queues at the cattle camps. Waiting for those five kilograms of straw for their animals. The district administration runs five such camps now. Each with about 10,000 head of cattle that their owners can no longer feed. Despair has driven new records in the distress sales of farm animals. Over 1.6 lakh head of livestock were sold off by May. That's 60,000 more than were sold in the whole of last year. And at absurd prices.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Animals that we bought for Rs.10,000 last year, we are now selling at Rs. 3,000 this year,\" says Seenu. He's talking to us in Daniyancheruvu village of Nallamada <i>mandal</i>. Seenu is one of many who have brought their starving cattle to the camp here, hoping to feed them.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe crowds at the camp are so large that tea and food stalls have sprung up to cater to  the thousands of farmers who have not only deposited their cattle here, but have also stayed on. \"There is no work to go back to,\" says Seenu's friend Raghu. \"We might as well hang on here and make sure the cows are fed and treated for disease. These cattle are our lives. They must have that fodder.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLuxury cars may be common in the town. Here, fodder is a luxury. Any of the 2,000 farmers standing in the queue for up to 12 hours for it would confirm that. There is a link, though, between fodder and luxury cars. Last year, the animal husbandry department claimed a loss of Rs. 385 crores due to the \"drought\". They had to save so many animals. Which mystifies anyone looking at the condition of the cattle they're supposed to have rescued. But in the block headquarters are parked shiny new vehicles.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>Drought is fodder for the fortunate. The last straw for the poor, but a big meal for the luxury class.\r\n</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet, the current administration of the district is a sensitive one. It is more responsive to people's distress than those previously. And it has shown the courage to take on sensitive  issues like caste and communal violence.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe administration here also showed restraint when faced with a State-wide protest in May. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Left parties were picketing the collectorates on the issue of hunger. But the authorities did not, for once, resort to standard strong-arm methods to disperse the 1,000 protestors.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAlso, on hearing of the crush at the cattle camps, the Collector, B. Rajashekar, moved to stagger the fodder hours. Each village the camps serviced was given a different time. The idea being to shorten queues and reduce the chaos.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut Anantapur's crisis is far older than the present set up. And rooted in larger factors both within and outside the district. In State and national policies which have wrecked its fragile equilibrium. In a path of development hostile to the poor.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn April, Adappa gave up. Creditors were making things difficult for  the small farmer from Oddicheruvu <i>mandal</i>. He'd sunk borewells to a depth of 500 feet at great cost on his land in Dabruvaripalli village. They didn't work. Spurious pesticides and bad seed cost more. The crop failed yet again and Adappa took his life in despair.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSelf-declared lenders soon showed up. \"They claimed he owed them Rs. 60,000,\" says his son Jaichander. \"But they would not show me the promissory note. Yet, they hoped to change the name on the note from his to mine. And wanted me to sign to that effect. I declined.\" Many families just cave in and sign. And end up as bonded workers of such creditors.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Every household here is deep in debt,\" he says. \"Even selling land won't help pay up. Land worth Rs. 25,000 an acre eight years ago won't fetch Rs. 6,000 now.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRamachandra Reddy of Choukuntapalli village in Nallamada <i>mandal</i> was another person  in debt. By March, Reddy could no longer support his young son who was studying for a computer science degree in Hindupur. Nor afford to get his youngest daughter married. He consumed pesticide. The four days it took him to die cost his family Rs. 40,000, which they had to borrow. Medical costs are at an all time high.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNow, his widow, Lillavatiamma, could lose their four acres to creditors. She is hit in other ways, too. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThree years ago, she would have got Rs. 10,000 under the \"Family Benefit Scheme\" to help her after her loss. But with suicides mounting in Anantapur, the government changed the rules. The sum was reduced to Rs. 5,000. As the deaths rose still further, the scheme was scrapped altogether for suicides.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"So I cannot get the Rs. 10,000 that would help my son complete his education,\" she says. Adappa and Reddy are just two among the 2,500 cases of suicides in Anantapur over the past six years.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nZero investment and a collapse of credit have ravaged agriculture. The landless poor have seen working days dwindle  as a result. Crippling rises in the costs of seed, fertilizer, power, pesticide and water have crushed small farms. The deeper the policies bite, the greater the casualties.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>There is a savage drought of compulsion afflicting policy makers.\r\n</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBack in the town, more luxury cars roll out of what is known as the \"Goodwill Colony\". This is an island of expensive apartment buildings. \"Goodwill\" is the term used to describe the 10 per cent kickbacks paid on all contracts in the district. Money from such kickbacks financed most of the buildings here. So <i>Eenadu</i> calls it the `Goodwill Colony\". Another name for it is the Food-For-No-Work Programme. The same people with homes here own so many of those cars.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe \"Automobile Revolution\" \u0097  that beloved clich\u00e9 of countless magazine covers \u0097  has arrived in Anantapur. But it's a very different kind of revolution than that which people here had hoped for.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhile the Scorpios zip around the streets of the town, the wheels of economic and social justice turn a lot more slowly in Anantapur. Here, drought is in the driver's seat.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\nP.

Its friend, the Telugu Desam (TDP), won 29 of the 34 Lok Sabha seats it contested. The BJP won seven of the eight it ran for in a tie-up with Mr. Chandrababu Naidu. This time, too, the State will be a decisive battleground in more ways than one. But this time, the simultaneous Lok Sabha and State Assembly polls could produce a very different result.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn 2004, the TDP-BJP combine faces a far greater challenge. One that could do more than change the State Government. It could undercut the NDA at the Centre, too. Andhra Pradesh ranks alongside Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra in importance in this election. Even in 1999, it helped the NDA experiment survive.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn that year, the TDP-BJP tie-up took 36 of the State's 42 seats. In the ratio of seats won to seats contested, that was the best result for any front the BJP was part of, in any major State. And the second best in absolute terms after Bihar (41/54 with the JD-U). The TDP's `outside support' was vital to the NDA in the Lok Sabha. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere's a fair chance the story could end differently this time. The deal the Congress has struck with the Telangana Rashtriya Samithi (TRS) will help it surge in that region. Both in the 107 Assembly and in the 15 Lok Sabha seats there. If it can clinch its seat sharing with the Left soon, it will gain in all regions. An effective Congress-Left-TRS deal could see huge changes in the pollscape.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere are 15 Lok Sabha seats in the Telangana region, where the Congress front seems ahead already. There are eight in Rayalaseema and 19 in Coastal Andhra. The Congress vote share in Andhra Pradesh rose four per cent in 1999. It even got more votes than the TDP. But it could not upset the math of the TDP+BJP combine. Fighting alone, it lost badly, winning just five of 42 seats. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet of the 29 seats the TDP took, 11 were closely fought. Seven of those, it won by margins of less than 3 per cent. Some of the most tightly contested seats showed margins of 0.46, 1.16 and 1.85 per cent. This, against a divided opposition.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the two seats of these 11 where the TDP won by 5 per cent, there were Left candidates undercutting the Congress. The CPI got 16 per cent of the vote in Bhadrachalam and the CPI(M) 4 per cent in Nellore. With Congress-Left adjustments, both seats become vulnerable. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere were at least two other seats, Pedapalli and Warangal, that the Congress would have won had it tied up with the Left in 1999. Some BJP wins were also frail. In three of seven seats where it won, its margins were just over two per cent. Two of those were Karimnagar and Medak \u0097  both in Telangana where a united Congress-Left-TRS vote could upset them \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn 1999, the Congress fared worst in Telangana. It took just two of the region's 15 Lok Sabha seats. Both the Congress and the Left fought alone and against each other. This time, their tie-up will have a big impact here.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the Assembly polls, the major battle lies in the 134 seats of Coastal Andhra. Why? With its TRS-Left alliance, the Congress has the edge in Telangana. And that front could grab 70 seats of the 107 in the region. (The Congress on its own took 42 in 1999). \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe distress Telangana has seen in recent years will not help the TDP-BJP. Lakhs of poor people migrated to other States last year seeking work. Take just the district of Mahbubnagar. In some estimates, a third of the populace was working outside it during much of the dry season. ( <i>The Hindu</i>  Sunday Magazine, June 1, 2003.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnger has only grown in a region that anyway has a strong sense of ill treatment. Agriculture lies shattered and rural debt has exploded. Farmer and weaver suicides continue. Mahbubnagar's case is poignant. This poorest district of the State is less than 100 km from hi-tech Cyberabad. Its reality offers a very different view of Mr. Naidu's model of governance. But the media's embrace of Mr. Naidu ensures his policies seldom get the scrutiny they deserve.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nCongress leader Y. S. Rajashekhar Reddy's padayatra through Telangana and Coastal Andhra last year surprised his own supporters. Mr. Reddy is from Rayalaseema. Yet the response to his tour saw even pro-Naidu media giving it huge daily coverage.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, with Rayalaseema seeing him as a possible Chief Minister, there is a fallout there, too. In 1999, the TDP grabbed 31 of the region's 53 seats. The Congress took 21. Alliance math and regional trauma could reverse that ratio this time. This is where Anantapur is. A district where some 2000 people, most of them farmers, have committed suicide since 1997. Drought was one part of it. The crushing of small farms was also policy-driven. Soaring input costs, lack of credit, the collapse of purchasing power, all these pushed many over the brink. And lakhs migrated from here, too, last year. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMr. Naidu has been trying for a year to shed his anti-poor farmer image. This is hard work. Last April-May \u0097  after his Government declared there was no hunger in the State \u0097  hundreds of citizen-run \"gruel centres\" sprang up in Telangana and Rayalseema. These makeshift free kitchens drew huge numbers of hungry rural poor. ( <i>The Hindu</i>  Sunday Magazine, June 15, 2003). \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt is in the 134 seats of Coastal Andhra that Mr. Naidu's political skills will be tested most. The last time, his front took 98 seats here. This time, he will play his `Telangana card.' This is, in short: The Congress is allying with the separatist TRS. A separate Telangana means a break-up of our beloved State. Defeat the Congress to save Andhra. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis could have a very powerful emotional impact. One that could touch Rayalseema, too. But it is diminished by the fact that his ally the BJP was the first national party to commit itself to a separate Telangana. In Telangana, the Congress front is ahead. And in Rayalseema, Mr. Naidu might cede some ground. So losses in Coastal Andhra spell big trouble for him and the NDA. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHad the Left been with it in 1999, the Congress would have gained close to 30 additional seats. That's apart from the seats the Left (which fought 93) would have gained. Instead, they ended up with 91 and two respectively in the 294-seat assembly. The TDP took 179 and the BJP 12.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Congress lost some 24 seats with tiny margins (about ten of them by less than 700 votes). Further, in 40 seats where it won by low margins, the Congress vote would have been much higher, but for the presence of Left candidates. In itself, that means little. But this time, it could improve the segment-wise performance of their Lok Sabha candidates.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTake a look at those seats where the Congress won \u0097  but where the Left also had candidates. In close to 35 of those, the Congress-Left would jointly have taken over 50 per cent of the vote. In ten of those 35, they would have drawn 55-60 per cent. In 11, between 60 and 70 per cent. So a deal with the Left helps the Congress significantly in both Assembly and Lok Sabha seats.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Left in Andhra Pradesh has votes in most constituencies. Even in the 201 it did not contest in 1999. The votes it could have brought to the table would have swung many more seats against the TDP. More so in a closely fought election. The BJP won 12 of the 24 seats it contested in 1999. But it could have lost half of these had the present tie-up existed then.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet Mr. Naidu too, has his own weapons. The first is of course the Congress-TRS tie up. He will harp on a possible break-up of the State. The Congress is yet to get its reply off the ground. It has so far not fully pressed home farmers' issues. Its campaign is poor and throws up few alternative policies. And trouble looms ahead in candidate selection and revolts. Mr. Naidu will also try setting the TRS against the Left.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTwo, the TDP gains from the Congress failure to formally name its chief ministerial candidate. Though Mr. Rajashekar Reddy seems the Congress choice, the TDP will make an issue of it: Naidu <i>vs</i> Who? Naming Mr. Rajashekar Reddy \u0097  a non-Telangana man \u0097  could blunt the \"break-up-of-Andhra\" campaign.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThird, Mr. Naidu's media blitz could make the BJP's India Shining campaign seem dull in contrast. He's put years of effort into what the latter is attempting in weeks. In the past few months, he's managed hours of airtime every day for days at a stretch on six private channels to report his `achievements' to the public. With public money.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFourth, the Opposition's worst nightmare is the timing of the polls. They come in a season where lakhs of poor, angry citizens are outside the State and cannot vote.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven so, this is not 1999. If the Congress cuts its deals quickly and gets its act and campaign together soon, Andhra Pradesh could undo its 1999 gift to the NDA. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

No one had ordered a plough in three years. Nor axe and spade handles either. Which meant that Bangaru Ramachari, who made tools and implements for farmers, was in trouble. He had been Mukundapuram's sole carpenter for years. He owned no land or cattle and was not a farmer. But his well-being depended on how agriculture in this village in Nalgonda fared.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"When farming does badly,\" says S. Srinivas, a political activist here, \"everyone does badly. Not just farmers.\" Ramachari did worse. He died of hunger. In a village that falls in the command area of the Left Canal of the Nagarjun Sagar project. Where farming had earlier done well for years\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe fault lines of the farm crisis are sending tremors far beyond the immediate community itself. Potters, leather workers, carpenters and numerous other non-farm groups have been hit by the crisis of agriculture that is driving the farmers' suicides in the state. The delicate and age-old linkages of the sector are under severe strain.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"I was away in Vijaywada working in a chappal company,\" says Aruna, Ramachari's widow. Women from the Voddrangi (carpenter) caste do not normally migrate in search of work. \"There was no choice,\" she says. \"I had never been a migrant worker before. But the chances of finding work here were nil.\" So she migrated a month at a time, leaving their three children with her husband.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Ramachari used to have around 40 clients,\" says Srinivas. \"They paid for his services with paddy. Each gave him 70 kilograms a year.\" Of the 2800 kg he got this way, he kept what his family needed and sold the rest on the market. \"He could get around Rs. 250 for 70 kg. Remember this was paddy, not rice.\" Yet, after retaining what his family required, he could make Rs. 4,000 in a year this way. \"With that, he took care of the family.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHe had even more clients earlier but problems began in the boom time. The coming of 12 tractors in the village reduced work. \"That hurt those who work with their hands,\" says K. Lingaiah. Landless workers like him also did badly from then on. For Ramachari, it was a blow. But he kept at his trade, trying to make things work. \"He had no other skills,\" says Aruna. He had studied till the 5th class. She till the 4th.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe tractors, though, were just the beginning. Much of the 1990s saw no investment in agriculture, public or private. Crop failure accompanied the stagnation. Farmers were no longer replacing their tools and implements. This was a disaster for Ramachari. \"What would we replace the tools for? How could we afford that? What would we do with the new ones?\" ask people in the village. At the same time, the older, worn-out tools further damaged what little agriculture was on.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat the canal now had little or no water didn't help.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, everyone was getting into debt. As input costs rose and farming failed, many borrowed just to keep afloat. Ramachari, 45, a proud and skilled artisan, was not keen on that route. In fact his debts of around Rs. 6,000 are surprisingly low for this region. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This village owes the Cooperative Society Bank alone Rs.22 lakhs,\" says K. Reddy an official of that body. They also owe the Gramina bank around Rs.15 lakhs and the State Bank of Hyderabad close to Rs.5 lakhs. \"And that's not the major amount,\" says Left activist S. Srinivas. \"Mukundapuram owes a great deal more than that to moneylenders.\" Perhaps, say people here, three times more.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhich means this village of 345 families carries a debt of over Rs.1.5 crore. With life becoming a survival game from there on, farming began to sink. And land prices have crashed from Rs.120,000 an acre to Rs. 60,000 an acre. \"Normally, people would hate to lose their land,\" says Gangi Narain Reddy a ryuthu sangham leader in the district. \"But now even for those desperate to sell, there is no one to buy.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome of the tractor owners lost their machines to creditors. It brought no relief to Ramachari as even the non-tractor farmers were no longer replacing tools. \"He was down to three or four clients in a year,\" says Srinivas. And in just recent times, the villagers lost over 30 bullocks in distress sales. That too, meant less work for the carpenter who made various items linked with their use.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNext came the migrations. \"Earlier,\" says Gangi Reddy, \"500 labourers used to come here each year seeking employment. That's gone. Now 250 people from here go as migrants searching for work.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe whole village was hungry this past year. Ramachari more than most. Ironically, two of the worst years they went through, India was exporting grain at prices less than those paid by poor people in this country. The only time the carpenter borrowed a little money from a neighbour, he bought some <i>nokalu</i> (broken rice) with it. The remains of the <i>nokalu</i> are still in the house. Aruna hasn't the heart to throw it away.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhile she went to a sweatshop in the city, hunger was biting Ramachari. \"We helped the children often with meals,\" says Muthamma, a neighbour. \"But he would act as if he was fine. He had not had a morsel for five days in his last week but was too proud to admit it.\" The neighbours, too, were doing badly. Yet, their help kept the children going. On May 15 this year, Ramachari collapsed. He was dead before Aruna raced back from Vijayawada. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nRamachari was swamped by a crisis of many layers. Most of which have also driven the farmers' suicides in this State. That have devastated Andhra's agriculture. Zero investment. High input prices. Crop failure. Rising debt. Criminal governmental neglect. Falling demand for his skills. And other layers, too.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAruna clings on to the hope that the Government will step in to help her family. As for Ramachari himself, the only government programme he had ever applied for was `Adharna.' One that gives artisans new tools. But the carpenter was gone before the tools could arrive.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

The rural poor, far more than the chattering classes, are the pillars of our electoral system. The vote is the one instrument of democracy they get to exercise. And they do that with telling effect, often using it to go out and change governments. This time, many of them cannot vote. The timing of the polls ensures that. It is in April-May that quite a few distressed regions see their largest exodus of migrant labour.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMillions will be out of their constituencies, seeking work to survive. These are not people who can send in postal ballots. Most cannot afford to return for the polls. If you are a worker from Orissa at a construction site in Mumbai, it is hard for you to vote in this season. (Someone else might vote for you while you are away \u0097  though not for the party of your choice). This is one result of early Lok Sabha polls.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSure, migrations are not new. That's all the more reason we should take them into account. They have been around long enough for us to know better. It's important, though, that distress migrations have risen since the early 1990s. And exploded since the late 1990s, with the collapse of rural employment.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLong before the migrations swelled to an exodus, the National Commission on Rural Labour found (1991) there were \"more than 10 million circular migrants in the rural areas alone. These include an estimated 4.5 million inter-State migrants and six million intra-State migrants.\" <i>And the NCRL report is outdated. It was in the 1990s that the numbers began to grow as never before.</i>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBoth the Census and the National Sample Survey Organisation grossly underestimate short-term migration. (Ironically, in 2001, such migration was so high in western Orissa, it distorted even the main Census headcount in some parts.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNSS data have drawn on a strange definition of `last usual place of residence' of a migrant. That is: \"the village where the person has stayed continuously for at least six months immediately prior to moving to the present village/town,\" where the person is counted. (NSS 43rd round.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis <i>excludes millions</i> locked into endless step-by-step migrations. <i>People who may not be anywhere for six months.</i> Footloose migrants who are almost always on the move, from place to place, just to survive. But the Census and the NSSO see migration as a single-shot event. Not as a process. So the many moves the migrants make are never captured. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nTake the months of April-May last year. Close to two million Oriyas were out of their State looking for work. An underestimate, but it still gives you an idea. Very few, though, were off for six months at a stretch. <i>Barely any were home for six months at a stretch</i>. Lakhs of people from just the three districts of Nuapada, Kalahandi and Bolangir were out. Just for the season. Pulling rickshaws in Raipur. Slaving at brick kilns in Vizianagaram. Working at great risk on high-rise buildings in Mumbai. The same migrants could be elsewhere at another stage of the same season. The way we define them gives us no clear idea of their numbers. Nor of how many of them are denied the vote as a result. We do know the figures are in millions. And rising.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe devastation of agriculture in the last decade makes the problem more acute. Zero investment, collapse of employment, a rise in debt \u0097  all are factors that have pushed millions more into the footloose army. At the same time, the towns and cities can absorb far fewer of them. There is much less work there, too. So the pressure on the migrants to keep moving only gets worse. Which means they go in for more and more short-term, footloose journeys in search of work.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, this year, we already have <i>The Hindu</i> (Feb. 28) reporting thousands of adivasis in Bolangir leaving their homes \"for survival.\" That's in February. What could it be like by April-May? Can these people vote?\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn that season last year, I boarded a bus for Mumbai from Mahbubnagar in Telangana. The idea was to join the migrants leaving the district in despair and hunger. Whole villages had seen more than two-thirds of their residents leave, looking for work. Only the very old and some young remained. Every traveller on that bus was a migrant wanting work \u0097  or a child of such migrants. Every bus on the route (with 58 seats), carried up to 100 passengers or more. The season brought record revenues for the Andhra Pradesh State Roadways and Transport Corporation there \u0097  on one-way tickets (most went back in under six months, though. Only to move out again in their quest for survival.)\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBuses plying that route went up from one a week 11 years ago \u0097  to close to 40 a week last year. At the same time, all three trains from the region ferried out tens of thousands more. The biggest group leaving were Lambada adivasis deep in debt. Followed by poor Dalits. (<i>The Hindu</i> Sunday Magazine, June 1, 2003.) This was just the Mumbai route. People from here go to 30 other destinations ranging from Gujarat to Rajasthan. In one estimate, over eight lakh people from Mahbubnagar were outside the district by April. Could they vote in such a season? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis year, one estimate looks at just Kurnool district. \"Over three lakh agricultural labourers have migrated to Guntur, Cuddapah, Hyderabad and other places of the State in search of work during the lean season.\" (<i>Frontline</i> Feb. 28-March 12.) Again, that is a February figure. What will it be by April? What's more \u0097  it is migration within the State. That too prevents many from voting. People from, say, Ramanathapuram, move to other parts of Tamil Nadu during April-May. Many leave the State as well. Either way, they mostly cannot vote. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn late April, there will be Biharis still in Punjab or Assam. Oriyas in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. People from Tamil Nadu on the road crews of Mumbai. Workers from Rajasthan struggling in Gujarat. Those from north Karnataka scouring Maharashtra. Adivasis from Madhya Pradesh in the brick kilns of Haryana. That's an incomplete list. In April-May, there will be countless millions of them. Forced to scrape out a living away from home.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet those at the bottom do want to vote. Malari village in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, rubbed that in during the 1998 polls. All communities had their voting booths within a few minutes of their homes. Except the Dalits of Malari. For them, the officials had set up a booth four km away. All vehicular traffic was banned on election day. Even cycles. No transport \u0097  and a booth so far away? This was meant to discourage them. But it didn't work. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOf Malari's 219 Dalit voters listed at this booth, nearly all turned out. The young assisted the old. A few in their Seventies made that four-km trek across the fields to vote. On arrival, some found they had \"already voted.\" The upper castes had saved them the trouble. Yet the rest voted and the <i>basti</i> rejoiced \u0097  a triumph of the human spirit and democracy. That was in mid-February.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut how many can make that trip in late-April 2004? Will the young be around to assist the old? How many would have left the district, searching for work during the lean months? How many of their votes will be cast by others? In some places, there has been `heavy voting' when no one is around.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMigrant workers tend to be concentrated in some clusters of villages within certain districts. So their absence in large numbers can strongly affect some seats. In a closely-fought election, they could make a crucial difference. Besides, they want to vote. Many have strong political opinions and clear ideas on whom they would vote for. But too often, they will tell you with regret, they were away and could not cast that ballot. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHow can this be resolved? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWe do take school exam schedules into account while planning election dates. And rightly so. (Even though those schedules are still based more on a British school calendar than on the Indian agriculture season.) Shouldn't we, likewise, take the survival schedules of millions of poor Indians into account? \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe time every rural Indian is most likely to be in his or her village is during the harvest season. That is their best chance of being present to vote. So, maybe, we need to weave election schedules with regional harvest schedules. Claims that people \"are too busy\" in this period help the landlords, not the workers. We are simply excluding an ever-growing number of citizens from the vote.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMillions of poor Indians have already voted \u0097  with their feet. They've left their homes in despair. Forced by a system that causes them such distress. One that tries, at every turn, to disable them and curb their democratic rights. In the process, they lose the vote. The one tool they treasure in fighting that system. By denying them that, we undermine them, ourselves, and democracy too. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>                                                         \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>                                                         \r\n</i>                                                        \r\n\r\n<!-- Bottom Template Starts -->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n<!-- story ends -->\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Printer friendly <a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2004031503631000.htm&amp;date=2004/03/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\npage</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">Send this article to Friends by </font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/pgemail.pl?date=2004/03/15/&amp;prd=th&amp;\">\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">E-Mail</font></a>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p><p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/classads/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/jobs/index.htm\">Employment</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p></font></p> <p>\r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">News: </font>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"../01hdline.htm\">Front Page</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../02hdline.htm\">National</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../23hdline.htm\">Tamil Nadu</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../21hdline.htm\">Andhra Pradesh</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../22hdline.htm\">Karnataka</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../25hdline.htm\">Kerala</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../24hdline.htm\">New Delhi</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../14hdline.htm\">Other States</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../03hdline.htm\">International</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../05hdline.htm\">Opinion</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../06hdline.htm\">Business</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../07hdline.htm\">Sport</a> | \r\n<a href=\"../10hdline.htm\">Miscellaneous</a> | \r\n</font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\"><br>Advts: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/classads/\">Classifieds</a> | \r\n<a href=\"/thehindu/jobs/index.htm\">Employment</a> | \r\n            </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Updates: </font>\r\n            <font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/\">Breaking News</a> | \r\n      </font>\r\n          </p> <p>\r\n      <!--begin ads-->\r\n</p> <p>\r\n      <!--end ads-->\r\n<br></p> <p>\r\n<font class=\"leftnavi\" size=\"2\">\r\n<ul><font class=\"leftnavi\" color=\"red\" size=\"2\">Stories in this Section</font><br><li><a href=\"2004031503661000.htm\">KARUNA'S CONFESSIONS</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031503651000.htm\">IIMs MUST STAND UP</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031503631000.htm\">The millions who cannot vote</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031503641000.htm\">Rising unemployment</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031506561100.htm\">Powell talks: the nuclear agenda</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031503621000.htm\">Sonia interview</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031503621022.htm\">`Gravest mistake'</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031503621023.htm\">Terror attack</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"2004031503621024.htm\">Road shows &amp;

He waits for the coconut to spin, tilt and fall. It does. This, he assures us, is the spot marked `X.' \"Here you will find water. Sink a borewell at this exact spot and you'll see.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Just a village away, Rayulu Dhomathimmana slouches across another field. The big forked twig he holds with both hands will guide him to water in Rayalappadhoddi. \"When the twig jerks upwards,\" he explains, \"that's the location.\" Rayulu modestly claims a \"90 per cent success\" rate for his method.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n In a different mandal, Chandrashekhar Reddy grapples with the question that has baffled philosophers down the ages. Is there life after death? Reddy thinks he knows. \"Water is life,\" he says. And so he has sunk four borewells in a graveyard. He has another 32 in his fields. And he has linked his spread out sources of water across his village of Jambuladhine with an 8-km long pipeline.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Superstition, the occult, God, government and technology have all been pressed into service in Anantapur's desperate search for water. Their combined strike rate has not been impressive. Poojari Anjaneyulu, though, claims otherwise. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe gentle, pleasant-mannered man says his method does not fail. He gained his skills from God. \"The only time it can let us down is when people force me to do this at the wrong hour,\" he says. (God charges Rs. 300 a borewell point.) And takes us across the fields, coconut swaying in his palm.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere will always be sceptics, though. Like one disgruntled peasant who tried this method in vain. \"The only water we found was in the coconut,\" he said gloomily. Meanwhile, Rayulu's twig has jerked upwards. He has certainly found water. On one side of him is a pond and on the other, a functioning borewell. Rayulu says he does not believe in God. The law is another matter. \"This display of skills won't lead to my landing in court for fraud, will it?\" he seeks our assurance. We give it to him. His success rate, after all, can't be much worse than the government's water surveyors. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nDismal record\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n The record of the groundwater department's geologists, if they can be called that, is dismal. In a few cases, wantonly so. It makes more sense to charge tidy sums working privately outside your office as water diviner. And if you come with the tag `expert,' a steady clientele is assured. Most of the points located by the experts in six districts we went to have failed. Even with borewells going down to 400 feet.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n So Poojari and Rayulu are just two members of a growing army of water diviners. All in the trade have eccentric methods of their own. They exist across the State and some of their more zany techniques have been listed by a young reporter with this newspaper in Nalgonda, S. Ramu. One includes a requirement that the diviner belongs to the `O' Positive blood group. Another seeks water below locations where snakes make their homes. Anantapur has its fair share of water eccentrics.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Beneath the surface frivolity, though, is a frightening struggle for survival in a district which has seen four successive crop failures. Reddy's graveyard borewells, too, are yielding less than he had hoped for. In all, this Village Officer (VO) has spent over a million rupees in his search for water. His debts mount by the month. \"Last week, I phoned on the government helpline,\" he says. \"I cannot carry on like this. We must have some water.\" The helpline was set up by the State's new Government to deal with those in distress amid continuing farmers' suicides. In a State hit worse than any other by farmers' suicides, Anantapur district has seen the maximum number. Here, in the past seven years, there have been over 500 in the `official' count. And many times that number in other estimates. Reddy's call on the helpline should serve as a clear warning signal. He is in a vulnerable group, right in the danger zone. Dreaming of water, drowning in debt. The horticulture in which he has so heavily invested is in ruins. So are his many borewells.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n The very rich are well placed to exploit this kind of crisis. Private water markets have swiftly emerged. Desperate farmers can buy a \"wetting\" for their fields at a cost of Rs. 7,000 or more an acre. This might mean paying a neighbour who has managed to corral access to whatever water there is. You can also buy that resource by the tanker load for a wetting. In this setting, commerce long ago overrode community. \"Can you imagine what all this does to our costs per acre?\" asks Reddy.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n Even the water diviners perform their wonders in tandem with the ubiquitous borewell rigs prowling the highways. The one opens up avenues for the other. Drinking water too, is a huge problem. Hindupur town's 1.5-lakh residents shell out an estimated Rs. 8 crores a year for drinking water. One local water lord has acquired large properties right around the Municipal Office.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n The rains, finally, appear to have begun. Four days of showers will see the sowing go ahead. Which means a possible return of hope and a let-up in the suicides. The problem, though, is far from over. A good crop would be hugely welcome, but will bring to surface other simmering problems. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Oddly, a good crop might spark new suicides,\" points out Malla Reddy, Director of the Ecology Centre of the Rural Development Trust, Anantapur. \"A farmer might at best make Rs. 1 lakh on it. But he has got Rs. 5 lakhs to Rs. 6 lakhs worth of debts to clear after years of crop failure. The crisis had delayed many marriages. Those will now have to be performed. Then there are the awful new input costs to be faced. How will he meet all these commitments? The pressure from the creditors will be enormous over the next few months. And the debt moratorium won't last forever.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n When it comes to farmers' problems here, it never rains but it pours. </p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>

This village in Nalgonda district has barely 2000 acres under cultivation. But it boasts over 6,000 borewells \u0097  two to every human being. Over 85 per cent of these wells have failed. The rest are in decline. The desperate search for water has bankrupted a once prosperous village.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBorewells loom large in the latest round of farmers' suicides in Andhra Pradesh. All those who took their lives had run up huge debts. A hefty chunk of this money (borrowed at interest rates of 36 per cent and above) was spent on borewells. Just 12 households that have suffered suicides recently had invested in 52 of them. All but four or five failed. They had spent close to Rs. 8 lakhs on these. And that is not counting the cost of pump sets. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMusampally has spent over Rs. 6.52 crores on its 6000 wells. If less than a third of that had been invested in completing a minor \u0097  and long-pending \u0097  irrigation project, the village would have been better served. \"I have tried my best to persuade them,\" says Narasimha Reddy, the dynamic ex-MLA of the area. \"But the borewell craze is deadly.\" Mr. Reddy had several water harvesting and canal-link projects sanctioned during his tenure. But borewell mania has since run berserk.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the 2004 election campaign, says Mr. Reddy, \"TDP and Congress candidates sank 400 wells free as part of their campaign.\" The `free' wells have added to the village's costs.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe unchecked exploitation of ground water has caused havoc in Andhra Pradesh. In the beginning, this simply meant that whoever could afford a borewell got the water. It also meant the privatisation of ground water. The richer you are, the more bores you sink. The more water you collar. Until it runs out.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe reigning champ in Musampally is Byrra Reddy. The village now calls him \"Borewell Reddy.\" He has sunk 55 wells in 20 acres of citrus. \"Of these,\" he says, \"49 have failed. It has been crushing.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhen 49 fail, why sink a 50th? \"You can lecture us about wasting money on borewells,\" says Jitendra Reddy. \"But we have invested our lives in this crop. So we just have to find that water. What alternatives have we been given?\" From successive governments so far, none. They have in fact encouraged a shift to often water-guzzling crops. And pushed for further privatisation of water.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe obsession with borewells is an optimism driven by despair. One more crop failure will send others into the suicide abyss. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"We have no skills for anything but agriculture,\" says Ramakrishna Peddaiah. (They use the word to cover the horticulture that is now Musampally's mainstay.) His family sank 30 wells. Ten of them in a single month, which saw his father B. Peddaiah lose his sanity. \"All ten failed and it drove him out of his mind,\" says Ramakrishna of his father, who sits by his side, uncomprehending.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhat would you do to get water if you had some money, we ask the people of Musampally. The answer is unanimous. \"We'd sink more borewells.\" That's from people who have each sunk 20-30 failed ones. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMusampally is not alone. Millions of bores have been sunk across Andhra Pradesh for some years now. No one knows how many. The water table lies devastated. Yet in this season, the highway crawls with mobile drilling rigs off to sink more wells.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe borewell industry seems to be booming. Shops dealing in them crowd almost every town in Telangana. There are 12 within close proximity in Kama Reddy in Nizamabad. \"It costs about 35 rupees a foot for the first 200 feet,\" says one employee at the Siva Ganesh store. \"Then it's ten rupees extra for every additional foot.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince the wells require protection in sandy soils, they need a casing. This runs to between 40 and 60 feet and costs Rs. 95 a foot. With casing, labour and transportation costs a well of 250 feet costs around Rs. 15,000. You need another Rs. 20, 000 to even think of a pump set.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd bores here run to depths of 300-400 feet these days. Of course, Anantapur outdoes Telangana districts in matters of depth. Bores crossing 800 feet have long ago ruined the water table there.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLingaiah in Biknor mandal of Nizamabad district sank the only successful bore in his village. \"It ruined my life,\" he says. His upper caste neighbours harassed him till he sold them his four acres at below the market price. The well is with the victors.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe laws meant to regulate the spread of the wells have failed. \"To monitor it at the field level,\" says a senior IAS officer, \"you must at least have working panchayats.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSince those were badly undermined in this past decade, the option does not exist just now. Collective action is almost forgotten. Each farmer thinks in terms of more borewells on his land and little else.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The process was wild and unregulated,\" says Prof. K. Nagaraj of the Madras Institute of Development Studies. \"From the start no questions were asked about who owns this water? Who does the aquifer belong to? What are the implications of siphoning it off this way? The earlier tank systems were quite iniquitous but there was some element of sharing. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSmall farmers were very dependent on this. The large number of small water bodies in and around the village was a great support to them.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith the coming of the borewells, these sources rapidly dried up. In thousands of villages, the local tanks have not filled up in years. The crisis of surface irrigation wounded the small farmer badly. Now even the big farmers who overmined the aquifer are hurting. \"If there is one perfect example of the anarchy of the market,\" says Prof. Nagaraj, \"this is it.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Musampally, Dharma Reddy shows me his ultimate symbol of the village's decline. The locked doors of \"Manjeera Wines.\" The local `brandy shop.' It used to do \"business worth Rs. 10, 000 a day,\" he says, wistfully. \"Now look at it.\" Over here, liquor won't be flowing like water for a while. And neither will water.</p> <p>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n                                                            \r\n</p> <p>

Sadly, thousands of others in his situation had the same idea at the same time. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe number of autos in Anantapur town shot up from 2,500 in the late 1980s to over 10,000 by the end of the next decade. \"For jobless people here, there were few other options,\" says Mr. Wali. Soon, \"there were too many autos. Earnings fell from Rs. 80 a day after costs, to half that or less.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt was not just the auto trade that collapsed. As thousands of workers lost their jobs and purchasing power in the mid-`90s, the farm crisis here grew. Countless small farmers saw their already troubled markets shrink further. The forced closures of large numbers of factories in this period hit the farmer long before the present drought did. Anantapur is the worst-affected district in the ongoing farm crisis.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Andhra Pradesh Lightings where Mr. Wali worked for years was a joint venture. \"This unit had problems but could have been turned around. We won State awards for best products and quality more than once,\" says Mr. Wali. \"But the private partner did not care. And the Government would not listen to us.\" So the 750 workers dependent on the company lost their jobs. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nClosures and lockouts\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe process began in the late 1980s with the closure of the Guntakal Spinning Mills. \"That was one of the biggest in Asia,\" says V. Rambhupal, CITU district president. \"Some 3,000 jobs were lost. Then came the rapid closures and lockouts of the 1990s. Hundreds of workers were thrown out when the Government-owned Nizam Sugar Factory Limited was sold and shut down. Since the NSFL used local produce, it also hit peasants badly.\" These were not drought-stricken farmers, but cane growers with a crop to sell.</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Likewise,\" says Mr. Rambhupal, \"closing the mulberry research centre at Penugonda hurt sericulture in Anantapur.\" The 1990s saw a wave of closures of both Government and private units in the district. Allwyn, the Bharat Gold Mining Ltd., and A.P. Oilfed were just a few amongst those that folded. The Pattabhi Forge and Anantapur Cotton Mills also went down with many others. \"It was the Government's policy to close lots of its own units. Private owners did the same for their own reasons,\" says Mr. Rambhupal.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nRise in child labour\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe shut downs went on through the 1990s. Many other units either folded or saw major retrenchment. A huge rise in child labour accompanied the process. And a big drop in wages further hit purchasing power. Where workers (as in A.P. Lightings) wanted the chance to run their own units, \"we were told it was impossible. No credit would be given,\" says Mr. Wali. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, close to 70 per cent of oil mills dealing with groundnut also shut down. And while employment growth in rural Andhra Pradesh fell to 0.29 per cent during this period \u0097  lower than in the rest of the country \u0097  Anantapur fared even worse.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSome former employees of the NSFL run tiny teashops and `beedi bunks' close to their old factory. People like B. Rajagopal who earned Rs. 4,500 a month in the late 1990s is lucky if he makes half of that now with his `beedi bunk.' Many tried migrating for jobs. \"Five or six of our fellow workers even died,\" says Mr. Rajagopal. \"Some of them were quite young. The stress was too much.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The Government made us sell them these grounds at Rs. 2,000 an acre before the plant came up in 1979,\" says Ugra Narashimappa. He is one of 29 small farmers who lost all their holdings to the NSFL for a pittance. \"Now we are landless. They promised us jobs that never came. Instead, this land is being sold for Rs. 50,000 an acre.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nReal estate was booming and there was money to be made on the unit's 160 acres. The NSFL was sold to a company that shut it down here and shifted its equipment to Karnataka. This, ex-workers point out, leaves the land up for sale. \"They should give it back to us,\" insist the now landless and jobless farmers. But they know it won't happen.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nLand of `milk and silk'\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe Hindupur region, known as the land of `milk and silk,' sank on both fronts. \"The children of milk producers drink less of it today,\" says Krishna Reddy, a farmer here. Their families have to sell every litre they can and that at very low prices. The dairies that used to buy the milk take much less now. Some are closed.\" Silk is in the doldrums. \"Output prices have sunk while input costs have soared,\" says Visweswara Reddy, district general secretary of the A.P. Ryuthu Sangham (APRS). \"The dumping of Chinese silk led to a crash in prices that crushed our producers. And you can see the WTO's impact in this taluka where 60 per cent of ryots depend on sericulture. The Government reduced import duties on silk from 100 to 30 per cent. Bigwigs in the silk trade in Gujarat also lobbied to get that done. Our growers were hit and thus reduced acreage for mulberry.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Up to 25 tonnes of cocoons came here each day in the 1990s,\" says Mujib Khan at the Hindupur market. \"Today, you won't see 20 quintals.\" All this, points out Mr. Visweswara Reddy, \"has fractured both jobs and farming.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSilk imports from China saw cocoon rates fall from Rs. 250 a kg in 1992 to Rs. 70 and less within a few years. In 2002, the APRS led over 10,000 angry farmers in a major protest. Their struggle forced the Government to take some action against dumping. But largescale smuggling and imports continue. Silk, which cost Rs. 2,200 a kg 12 years ago, sells for about a third of that now.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLong before the drought bit deep, Anantapur was already in trouble. The close links between workers, farming and industry were broken by the new policies of the 1990s. Thousands of workers and farmers were being displaced at the same time, with no new options. As jobs became scarce and farmers faced new costs and lost old markets, and as credit vanished, Anantapur slipped further into crisis. \"A crisis driven by policy,\" says Mr. Rambhupal of the CITU. But now laid entirely at the door of drought. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p>

He works in one of the biggest seed and fertilizer stores in town, owned by a relative of his. \"We have no scientific qualification,\" admits the polite Rao. \"We only guide them by experience. We ourselves consult the manufacturers.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSeeds, fertilizer and pesticide dealers are at the centre of a growing controversy in Andhra Pradesh. They are the new moneylenders to a peasantry strapped for credit. \"The banks have given no loans in the past seven years,\" says Malla Reddy, general secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Ryuthu Sangham (APRS). \"So many farmers are forced to depend on sources like these for credit. The same man advises them on what to buy and then sets the rates for the purchase.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWith the seed dealers tacking on hefty interest rates to their credit sales, the problem gets sharper. Nageswara Rao admits to a charge of two per cent a month on bills, but says there is no choice. Times are bad. \"Besides, we are quite lenient as we wish to help the farmer. Sometimes, they agree to pay in 60 days but may not do so for 90 to 120 days.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nNew Seed Act planned\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFarmers in Nalgonda's villages are sceptical of this altruism. \"Each month's delay adds to the interest,\" points out P. Bhiksham in G. Edavalli village.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet, the farmer often goes by the dealer's advice on what products to buy. \"The dealer has emerged an `expert', because the others have gone,\" says Malla Reddy. The APRS leader points to \"over 2,800 vacancies in the Department of Agriculture. The last Government only appointed 7,000 unqualified people on contract. They had no background in agriculture.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany of the farmers' suicides in the State have been largely debt driven. Which makes the seed dealer's role more of a problem. Some of those who took their lives did so because of both, huge debts and crop failures due to spurious seeds and pesticides. But there is little punishment for those selling fake seeds.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Just Rs. 500,\" says the new Agriculture Minister, Raghuveera Reddy. He hopes to bring some order to a system now out of control. \"We have recovered spurious seeds worth Rs. 7 crore in raids in only the past month,\" he told us. But the offenders are people for whom the Rs. 500 fine is a joke. So the Government intends to bring in a new Seed Act at the State level.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAndhra Pradesh's record of curbing such fraud in the past has been dismal. \"Till date, no case filed by the State against a seed or pesticide dealer has ever been won by the Government,\" says Yalamanchili Shivaji. He is a former Rajya Sabha MP and a well-known farmers' leader here. \"In contrast,\" he claims, \"almost no such case filed by the Tamil Government was lost.\" Dr. Shivaji also points out that Andhra Pradesh has fewer agriculture and extension officers than any southern State. \"The Naidu Government was bent on privatising extension work,\" says Malla Reddy.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe matter gets more complex given the clout the seed dealers have gained. And the alarming rise in the cost of inputs they control. Per acre costs have exploded since 1996.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs farmers in G. Edavalli explain: The cost of paddy seeds an acre almost tripled from Rs. 120 in 1996 to around Rs. 350 now. That of urea nearly doubled from around 120 then to nearly Rs. 230 now. Pesticide, ammonia phosphate, zinc  -   all these have more than doubled in cost.\" A farmer might buy most of these inputs from the same dealer.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nInput costs higher\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nOther expenses, too, have risen. Tractors cost a lot more than manual work did. \"In 1996,\" say farmers in G. Edavalli, \"we could raise an acre of paddy within Rs. 3,500. Today that is Rs. 7,500 or more.\" Add higher power tariffs and water costs and people are now paying well over double what they did in 1996. Those who left food crops to experiment with cash crops in this period pay still more.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe 24 per cent interest that seed dealers tag on makes the burden that much worse. And with seed companies hawking a \"germination rate\" of only 65 per cent, farmers get even less value for money.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis is Telangana. Input costs are higher in coastal region where, too, suicides have been on. The use of high cost items such as fertilizers and pesticides is greatest in Andhra Pradesh. The All-India average for fertilizer consumption per hectare was 88 kg in 2001. In Andhra Pradesh it was almost 180 kg. It is even greater in the coastal region. \"Over use of fertilizer is a huge problem,\" says Malla Reddy of the APRS.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nDwindling returns\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"At the same time,\" he says \"tenant farmers faced massive increases in the cost of leasing land.\" Such tenants make up nearly 60 per cent of all farmers in many parts of the State. More so in the coastal region. From the late 1990s, they were asked by the landlords to pay (as lease cost) between 21 and 25 bags of paddy an acre each year. This, when their output was barely 30 bags an acre. So the tenant farmer is left with five bags of paddy and another three of black gram that he sows after paddy. And that is in a good year!\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBy the late 1990s, the farmer was wilting. In 1996, \"he was making Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 6,000 an acre on an input cost of Rs. 3,500. Now he is making Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 an acre on cost of close to Rs. 8,000. Between then and now, productivity has only risen from 25 to under 30 bags an acre. This huge use of fertilizer has not helped much.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"But at the moment when input costs were so high and rewards so poor,\" says the Nalgonda ex-MLA, Narasimha Reddy, \"the banks stopped giving the farmer any credit. And output prices were crashing due to rigged and volatile markets. There was also zero investment in agriculture. This crisis was man-made.\" That was how the suicides began. \"Add drought and crop failure to that,\" says Reddy, \"and the suicides only got worse.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">

And the reverse of its packet states \"Germination rate 65 per cent.\" What does it mean, we ask the residents of Rentapalla in Guntur district. \"It means one-third of the seeds will not work,\" scoffs one farmer. \"When we pay, we pay for 100 per cent,\" he laughs. \"Not for 65 per cent.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn short, if this village pays for 1,000 bags of seed, they are only getting 650.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"Would you,\" asks another farmer, \"go to a pharmacy and buy a medicine of which one-third should not be expected to work?\" Then why buy these seeds? \"What choice do we have?\" Most companies and dealers follow the same practice.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"This is a post-1998 system,\" says Malla Reddy, general secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Ryuthu Sangham (APRS). \"When the multinationals entered the field, controls and regulation were dropped. Before that, seeds were certified by State authorities. Germination was up to 90 per cent. It was the MNCs who started this practice.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nReceipts of seeds\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Rentapalla, farmers give us the bills and receipts issued to them by seed and pesticide dealers. Even apart from the very high prices, these are unique in two respects. One, they explicitly add on an interest rate of 2 per cent a month (24 per cent) on the goods sold. Two, they extract a signed undertaking from the farmer absolving the dealer of any responsibility for failed or spurious seeds. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBoth clauses are clearly printed on the bills and receipts. They are part of the `legal' transaction. Take for instance the bill issued by Vijayadurga Agencies at Sathenapally in Guntur district. It carries (in Telugu) a clear disclaimer. This includes the caution that these seeds should be sown \"after ascertaining that they sprout well.\" The onus of testing them is on the farmer.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe note also asserts: \"Seeds billed herein belong to the respective companies. They are sold only on being certified as fit after carrying out all technical scrutiny.\" Why then should the farmer be responsible for testing them? But the note goes further. Too many things depend on nature, it says. \"Therefore no guarantee can be given.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe farmer then signs below the last line which says, \"I purchase the seeds agreeing to the above points.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nStockists like Vijayalakshmi Pesticides add their own clauses for the farmer to sign on. \"I am aware that these pesticides are poisonous and I purchased the items billed herein for the purpose of agricultural operations.\" \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nThe new moneylenders\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDealers are well aware of what other purposes the \"purugu mandhu\" (literally insect medicines) have been used for. The overwhelming majority of farmers who have committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh have done so by consuming pesticide. Hence the clause freeing the dealer of any responsibility. A further line tagged on says: \"Agreed to pay interest at two per cent a month on this bill amount.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeet the new moneylenders of the countryside. The seed, pesticide and fertilizer dealers. \"This man is a new sahucar,\" says Malla Reddy of the APRS. \"He is at once a merchant, a moneylender, a scientist, an agro-technologist and an expert. He can also be the man who buys the crop of the farmers he sells products to. At low prices, of course.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe power this group wields is a vital factor in the ongoing crisis and continuing suicides of farmers.  With soaring input costs and the collapse of formal credit, their writ binds the dependant farmers. This group gains in many ways, of which three stand out.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFirst, the seeds and pesticides dealer inflates prices on the plea that he is extending credit to the farmer. \"You end up paying Rs. 230 for Rs. 200 worth of pesticide,\" says P. Bhiksham at G. Edavalli village of Nalgonda district. \"But you sign on a bill which still says Rs. 200.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSecond, the two per cent interest a month is tagged on to the bill amount. \"There have been repeated crop failures,\" says farmer Kobbanna Venkatrao at Sathenapally, Guntur. \"So repayments get delayed. That's when you learn what 24 per cent interest means. Their seeds have often been responsible for our crop failure. But there is no punishment for that. We suffer the crop failure, but pay them penalty rates of interest.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThird, they might have to sell their crops to the same man who sells them seeds and pesticides \u0097  at a rate fixed by him. That rate can be \"well below the minimum support price,\" says K. Veeranjaneyulu, a farmer in Rentapalla. \"More so, if the farmer is small and cannot bargain. Last season, the market rate for chilli was Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,200 a quintal. Some small farmers sold to their dealers at Rs. 1,500 a quintal.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"The way it all works,\" says Vinod Rao, also a farmer in Rentapalla, \"is this. For every Rs. 5,000 we spend, the seed fellow gets Rs. 1,000 of it. Often more.\" This equation imposes a deadweight on the farmer's input costs.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe unfairness of it rankles. \"All gains are the dealer's, all losses are ours,\" says one peasant here. The APRS has tried hard to tackle the situation. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<font class=\"subsectionhead\" size=\"3\" color=\"red\">                \r\nRole of MNCs\r\n<p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p></font>                                                     \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n\"There have been lots of crop failures due to fake seeds,\" says APRS district secretary Narasimha Rao. \"Our experience is that it is very difficult to bring the big MNCs to book for bad or failed seeds. They never respond. So we try to compel the dealer here to compensate the peasant where a blatant wrong has been done. But the farmer is very vulnerable to his pressure. So it is not easy.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe clamour is growing for amending the Seed and Pesticides Acts at the Centre to bring some regulation to this field. The new Andhra Pradesh Government is also readying its own Seed Act at the State level. The changes won't come a day too soon for P. Bhiksham. \"The old Sahucar was bad,\" he says. \"But at least he was lenient at crop time. He was part of the village and needed the crop to succeed. With these people, they are more ruthless. You can die but they have to get their money. I tell you, the old sahucar was better.\"\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n

It has led, among other things, to his being bitten by a snake and several times by scorpions. ``I do not know who the great people who make things this way are,'' he says in Ankilla village. ``But clearly they know nothing about farming. No one with any knowledge of agriculture and villages can run things in this fashion.'' Many in this village in Koilkonda <i>mandal </i>of Mahbubnagar district grumble in assent. Nawab, Rajanna and Kotharajanna are among the many here who have suffered snakebites. Even <i>sarpanch </i>Chenna Reddy has tasted the serpent's tooth. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSnakes and electricity? Reptiles and reforms? Sounds bizarre? It is a complaint you can hear across the State. (And in Rajasthan, too.) In Anantapur and Mahbubnagar districts of A.P., it is fairly widespread. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe furious debates over power ``reforms'' have raged mostly around the massive hikes in tariffs that squeeze millions of small farmers. However, there were also less visible non-financial costs. A price being paid by many farmers on the ground. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``There has been a huge increase in snake bite cases,'' nods Pagaku Hanumanthappa. Close to 80, he is perhaps the best traditional healer \u0097  or <i>vaid</i> \u0097  of Anantapur. He takes no money for his services. A couple of coconuts or some rice could make up his fee. Age has slowed him down, but his 30-year record in treating snakebite victims is legendary. ``I had eight cases in early August alone,'' he says sitting in Ammavarapalli village in Pennukonda <i>mandal</i>. ``And then it began climbing. It is far more than it was two years ago. There are scores of cases in just this vicinity.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat still does not tell us what all this has to do with the power reforms. The links of the current distress to the health reforms are clearer. The Government is abandoning public health and draining it of funds. The primary health centres (PHCs) are turning away poor people going there for treatment. In the C.K. Palli <i>mandal</i> PHC, staffers openly tell us: ``we refer snakebites to the <i>vaids</i> and the rural medical practitioners.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSo as cases of snakebites go up, in-patient lists in this PHC go down. All other medical institutions and practitioners confirm a rapid rise in snakebite cases. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nDr. Geyanand, a highly respected doctor of Anantapur town, is worried by the costs poor farmers are facing. ``Many have spent Rs. 40,000 or more on treatment for snake bites,'' he says. Some of those coming in to his own clinic were first turned away from PHCs or elsewhere. ``Or else, they come in very late and in a bad state. Often, they have already spent some money. There were two cases where I had to send them to Bangalore on artificial ventilatory support. They could not have survived here. In all, it would have cost them a lakh of rupees.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``There is a big shortage of anti-snake bite serum,'' says Prabhakar Naidu, resident medical practitioner in Kadiri <i>mandal</i>. ``A vial can now fetch Rs. 1,000 in the black market.'' Naidu sees more snake bite cases than any one else. At least two PHCs admit to sending him patients. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``Who are the patients? Without exception, all <i>ryuthulu </i>(farmers). In 30 years,'' he laughs, ``I have never seen a <i>sahucar </i>bitten by a snake, only farmers.'' His tone suggests the region's <i>sahucars </i>are themselves of reptilian origin. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nSnakebites do not surprise either the <i>vaid</i> or Naidu. ``That is an occupational hazard for farmers. Especially when the rains come, or during the harvest,'' says Naidu. What alarms both is the sharp rise in attacks in the past 15 months. ``I have had 15-20 cases daily at my clinic this season,'' says Naidu. ``There is no respite.'' One reason for the shortage of the serum, he insists, is that militant groups like the People's War Group (PWG), the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and others operating in jungle terrain buy large quantities of it. But whichever way you cut it, ``the number of cases is climbing rapidly''. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd yes, it has ``tremendously increased'' post-power reforms. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``What do you expect if they release power for farming at 3 a.m.?'' asks Kawala Ramulu, back in Mahbubnagar district. A dozen voices join him. ``No one asks what time suits us. If the current is switched on at 3 a.m., someone has to be there to switch on the pump-set and monitor the flow of water. So at least one member of the family has to sleep in the fields each night.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat person gets busy at 3 a.m.. And that is when the snakebites occur. Most cases we encounter in both districts took place at around this hour. And almost all happened near the pump. ``Snakes are quite short sighted,'' says <i>vaid </i>Hanumanthappa. ``And they do not expect to find human beings stepping on them at that hour. They are chasing rats and other prey at the time. It annoys them.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt annoys Venkatesulu too. Because that is just what happened to him. ``This 3 a.m. electricity is killing,'' he says bitterly in Mushtikovila village in C.K. Palli <i>mandal</i>. ``Yes, I was bitten right near the motor. It was too damn dark to see anything.''\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe appearance of water at that hour in the parched fields has other effects too. Effects obvious to all, except \u0097  as Kawala Ramulu points out \u0097  the ``big people'' planning the power reforms. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``No one counts scorpion bites. There are too many. Snakes, yes, there is a big rise in attacks,'' says Chandramouli in Gollapalli village, Anantapur. ``But please remember that all creatures need water. If water shows up in the field at 3 a.m., so will wild animals.'' They did. And Chandramouli was gored by a wild boar. He still bears the scar and points to it with some disgust. Boars have also attacked four others in the village. This is besides those, like Prasad and Adi Reddy, who were bitten by snakes. A farmer in Chettipalli village in Mudigubba has been bitten thrice. Others have been turned away from government hospitals. The victims of the power reforms swiftly become victims of the health reforms. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet even those farmers affected by this fallout are focussed on the tariff hikes. ``It is too much. We cannot afford this. That too, for a third-rate supply that breaks down all the time,'' say Ramulu and his friends. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAndhra Pradesh enforced its ambitious ``power reforms'' over 15 months ago. And few States have followed the World Bank-charted script so diligently. The general impact of this on farmers has been severe. For those in drought-prone areas it has been devastating. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nPeople using just one bulb in their homes \u0097  for the few hours that the electricity comes \u0097  pay Rs. 125 a month. Nearly twice what they paid earlier. Those using the smallest pump-sets (up to 3 hp) pay more than double now. Their costs went from Rs. 95 to Rs. 195 overnight. In short, the worst-off farmers landed the steepest hikes. This, in drought areas. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe promise of the reforms was nine hours of electricity. That draws ridicule. ``Sure,'' scoffs farmer Adi Reddy. ``It comes on for an hour, and then breaks down. Then it returns in two hours and goes off again after half an hour. Finally, those nine hours are spread across 15. Have you ever tried cooking <i>dal </i>across 15 hours? Would you switch off after three minutes and resume after an hour? They seem to want us to conduct farming in that style.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis season, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu announced 12 hours of power. But in the villages, this \"gift\" is dismissed with scorn as a ploy to charge even more for less. Power supply hours were fixed arbitrarily. From 3 a.m. to 9 a.m. and then again from noon to 6 p.m.. And even that is notional, given the constant breakdowns. This frustrates and thwarts the farmer. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``Just now,'' says Ramulu, ``it is 2.20 p.m.. Going by schedule, power should have been on from noon. Actually, it went off at 9 a.m. and never returned. But we will have to pay for this, mind you.'' \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFor pump-sets between 3 and 5 hp, the costs shot up from Rs. 200 to Rs. 350 a month. The rates brought in were high and complex. The results were stark and direct. Power reform is now one of the most lethal factors disrupting agriculture in A.P. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``The power hardly comes. Only the bills come,'' says Sivaram Reddy. Many farmers in his village of Mallayagaripalli in Anantapur district have had their supply cut \u0097  for power they never used. ``Not only have the rates gone up, we do not get the damn power.'' Yet, the Government has lodged cases of ``power theft'' against hundreds of farmers. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n``When there is power, there is very low voltage or volatile fluctuations,'' he says. Voltage fluctuations have destroyed thousands of motors across the State. ``Those simply burn up, costing us a fortune. If we get power for five of the nine hours promised, we would be happy. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt does not happen. Spending on repair and replacements of motors has been quite high. Far more than poor farmers can cope with. A lot of them approve of the fierce anti-tariff hike agitation that shook the State between May and August last year. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMeanwhile, they struggle with the crippling costs \u0097  and with snake and scorpion bites. For them, it is a case of how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a worthless reform. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>P.

Imagine what we could do with a bad one. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd so far, it doesn't look good. Many reservoirs in Orissa are close to \"dead storage levels\". At that point, you can't release water for power generation or irrigation. And Orissa is a State where distress sales from the last crop wrecked lakhs of farmers, anyway. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn Andhra Pradesh, the number of peasants voting with their feet is on the rise. Even in already high-migration districts like Anantapur. Rajasthan's rural poor are seeing the shredding of the little food security they had left. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nClose to two-thirds of all districts have seen poor rainfall. For rural folk dependent on agriculture, the next 20 days will be thick with tension. Some rains now in Rajasthan, A.P. and Maharashtra hold out a little hope. But if there's no more by August 15, we're looking at major crop loss. If August 15-31 goes the same way, recovery won't be easy. Distress levels, already high, will soar. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThis is just the beginning. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe rural poor, especially landless labourers will take a hit five ways, at least. A fall in income is obvious. For many, the period from about August to October is anyway critical. Those are the hungry days, the period between sowing and harvest \u0097  even when there is a normal monsoon. That's when work is hardest to find and survival games sharpen. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nImagine where the sowing hasn't happened. Or where it fails, or is much less than usual. Employment dips further. So even the wages that would have eased a part of the hungry days are missing. A reduced harvest makes things bleaker. Farmers will lose out on production. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAs food prices rise, so will hunger in rural households. Even last year, adivasi homes in Rajasthan were rotating hunger amongst family members. Each day, one of them would go without anything to eat at all. Those who did get to eat \u0097  a single meal \u0097  would go out and look for work that day (<i>The Hindu </i>Sunday Magazine, March 18, 2001). \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nMany who own a few goats or fewer head of cattle could lose them. Distress sales of livestock are on even now in several States. Looking after farm animals becomes a huge problem with rising fodder costs \u0097  and less water. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe debt situation gets much worse. Quite a few of those who might own an acre or two of land are likely to lose it. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe \"normal\" avenues of work in other seasons aren't there. No construction work or road laying. No brick making. So heading for the city \u0097  as lakhs are doing \u0097  won't be of too much help. In fact, it will bring about a crash in the daily wages of labourers in the cities. As it happened last year in Hyderabad and Vizianagaram, with workers from Orissa streaming in. As it did in Bangalore, too, with migrants from Anantapur flooding the city. Also, those coming to the cities will find that their \"Below Poverty Line (BPL)-Above Poverty Line (APL)\" cards mean nothing. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat is, those who have not already lost their cards to the village moneylender. Tens of thousands did last year, in Orissa (<i>The Hindu </i>Sunday Magazine, June 24, 2001). \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe pressure on women in rural households will be huge. The time and energy they spend in fetching water, firewood and fodder shoots up. But their food intake goes down. The women eat last, after feeding the rest of the family. They then have to worry about feeding the livestock. That mix of rising exertion and falling nutrition will devastate many. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWhen things go wrong, they can't afford health costs. The policies of the past decade have smashed what little the rural poor have had on the public health front. The drive towards privatisation and \"user fees\" has been thorough. Indeed, loans taken for health spending make up one of the fastest growing segments of rural debt in the country. (<i>The Hindu </i>Sunday Magazine, May 6, 2001.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nChildren will drop out of school in large numbers because they can't afford to go. Or to join their migrating parents. That's what happened most years of the ongoing crisis, drought or no drought. In one part of Anantapur last year, the children spent most of August earning money for their families by capturing pests. Landowners paid them Rs.10 for each kilogramme of Red Hairy Caterpillar they brought in. A kilo meant catching over 1,000 caterpillars. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n</p> <p align=\"left\"></p> <p>                                                \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThere's an urgent need to provide work and incomes to the rural poor. But most governments don't want to spend even the modest cash component that major food-for-work programmes need. They can tolerate Rs.100,000 crores in unpaid debt by a handful of business houses that even the finance minister calls \"a loot\". Even while doing that, Jaswant Singh makes the avuncular offer that if any of the looters have a genuine problem, they can approach him. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLandless workers and other rural poor don't get to \"approach\" the finance minister. Nor do they dine with him each year as the defaulters in the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) do. They do sometimes take out big protests that the media largely ignore. They don't own newspapers and television channels. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBy the time public outrage has forced governments to get serious about food-for-work programmes, many of the old will be too weak to do the kinds of labour those sometimes involve. What if you are over 50 years of age? And if you have not eaten at even your normal pathetic level for two months. Try digging the required 70 cubic feet a day for the rotten grain the government will dump on you. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd yet, the drought is discussed mostly as a natural phenomenon. As if everything was fine until it came along. And the failure to cope with it seen as one of \"faulty implementation\" of noble projects and schemes. Really? In fact, the problems lie first in the policies. Most of them anti-poor in design and content. In fact, the last decade saw the best implementation of the worst policies. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nInvestment in agriculture collapsed in the 1990s. And, at 1.8 per cent, the growth rate in food grain production in the 1990s was about half of what it was in the 1980s. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNo surprise then, that the last seven years of the 1990s saw our lowest rate of growth of rural employment since 1947 \u0097  0.67 per cent. Rural credit folded in the 1990s, pushing farmers towards moneylenders. The mounting crisis saw many lose their land or other meagre assets. All this rocked the fragile balance the poor struggle to maintain. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThey've been pounded for over a decade by such policies. Reduced to a state of high vulnerability by conscious human decisions. Drought, or other calamity when it occurs, makes this unbearable situation impossible. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nYet, in all the discussion over it, not a word is being said about the next major policy direction this country will move on \u0097  sooner rather than later. The first \u0097  camouflaged \u0097  moves have already been made. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat is, the privatisation of water. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nHaving faithfully followed the World Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) script on economy and development for some years now, the move to privatise water is quite logical. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nNever mind that this is a country where large regions are wholly dependent on rain-fed tanks and canals. Nor that it will devastate the poor. Never mind that in countries where the process has gone further, the chaos has been terrible. Never mind, too, that in this country it could create unbelievable levels of violence in the countryside. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nFACT: During year 2000 alone, IMF loan agreements in 12 countries included conditions imposing water privatisation or \"full cost recovery\". \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThose pushing these agendas have a sense of the likely fallout. In India, this sector has not seen the kind of bravado in public statements that privatisation in other sectors has. Here, it's the benign route. At least, in some places. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nWater is really being handed over to \"the community\" who have formed themselves into \"water users' associations\". \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThat's a cute term: \"water users\". The rest of us, it seems, are non-water users. Just a form of dry land bacteria that do not need the liquid to survive. Spinning off from the positive ring to the word \"panchayat\", come the <i>pani panchayats</i>. Many of these quite fraudulent. Some, once decent, are being steered towards straight commercialisation. A hijacking of a once democratic concept. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn many parts of A.P., the \"water users'\" association is now headed by the biggest contractor of the region. Common control by all the farmers in the command area of a major water source exists only in theory. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnother method is already in use in States like Orissa. Through a \"lease\" agreement, the management of a State-owned asset (say, a canal) is leased out to a <i>pani panchayat</i>. It will not be all that long before the same logic extends to private corporations. The money to finance these schemes comes from the public, of course. The profits will be private. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nEven at a micro level, the emergence of private water markets has been on for some years now. In Ramnad, in Tamil Nadu, a class of people emerged in the late 1980s whom locals call the \"Water Lords\". Yet, the exploitation of scarcity for profit at the village level has in fact been lauded as \"efficient\" and good. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIt surely is good for somebody in Rajasthan. There, if you live in a water-scarce village, you buy what your family needs from a tanker. At only 200 times what it costs per litre in the city of Jaipur. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nIn the present distress, the economists of the CII and similar bodies see an opportunity. \"Let's use this time of adversity to accelerate the process of reforms,\" writes one.\"... Increase the pace of privatisation ... start freeing land markets.\" He does not mention water. But you can bet it's on the agenda. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nAnd here we are, a nation with huge conflicts and tensions over water, heading that way. With a bunch of planners pretending they aren't thinking that way at all. Knowing all the while that they are. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut back to the drought, there's no problem, you see. We have 63 million tons of \"surplus\" grain. You can only girdle the globe 38 times with that. Or build a ladder to the moon. So mainstream economists assure us we can take care of hunger. (Come to think of it, there is no situation ever where mainstream economists go hungry.) \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nThe point is not: \"Aha! We have 63 million tons of grain lying around. So there's no problem.\" The point is that the 63 million tons is a big part of the problem. It exists because the purchasing power of the poor has been so severely trashed by policy. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nLast year, for instance, India exported rice at Rs. 5.65 a kg. We sold the same rice to people in drought-hit regions of Andhra Pradesh at Rs. 6.40 a kg. The export price of wheat was even less than the BPL rate of that item in many States. \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBesides, agriculture is not only about output. It is also about livelihoods \u0097  which have swiftly frayed in the last 10 years of assault on the poor. Those battered and bruised by that process now face two of the media's favourite phrases: the \"vagaries of the monsoon\". And, of course, \"drought\". \r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\nBut wait till we privatise water. That'll make it truly efficient.\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<b>(To be continued)</b>\r\n</p> <p align=\"justify\">                                           \r\n<i>P.
