      "description": " The koilawallahs, or coal carriers of Godda district try earning a living by picking up coal from the waste dumps near the Rajmahal mining project at Lalmatiya and pushing huge loads of it  --  ranging from 100 to 250 kilograms  --  to Godda town 40 kilometres away. There, poor consumers buy this cheap coal via local merchants. It’s a national energy saving, but has been criminalised by officialdom. And the koilawallahs would be lucky to earn a net of Rs. 30 per trip. These photographs were shot in September 1993, on a Nikon F 3. Godda was then in the state of Bihar. Since  year 2000, it has been a part of Jharkhand state. You can also read the original report on the coal carriers of that time, appearing in the book Everybody Loves A Good Drought, by clicking on the print icon.",

      "description": "Kishen Yadav pushing his heavy load of coal on a bicycle with reinforced bars and without a chain (since he’s removed that to reduce friction). He’s on his 40-km journey from Lalmatiya to Godda town. Some koilawallahs push further, maybe up to 60 or even 80 km away. From their meagre earnings, they pay a hafta (a ‘cut’ or bribe) to the coal mafia and at various police checkpoints",
