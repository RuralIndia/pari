In some of the States worst hit by the agrarian crisis, they were well over 100 per cent higher. The new Census 2011 data reveal a shrinking farmer population. And it is on this reduced base that the farm suicides now occur. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nApply the new Census totals to the suicide data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and the results are grim. Sample: A farmer in Andhra Pradesh is three times more likely to commit suicide than anyone else in the country, excluding farmers. And twice as likely to do so when compared to non-farmers in his own State. The odds are not much better in Maharashtra, which remained the worst State for such suicides across a decade. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cThe picture remains dismal,\u201d says Prof. K. Nagaraj, an economist at the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai. Prof. Nagaraj's 2008 study on farm suicides in India remains the most important one on the subject. \u201cThe intensity of farm suicides shows no real decline,\u201d he says. \u201cNor do the numbers show a major fall. They remain concentrated in the farming heartlands of five key States. The crisis there continues. And the adjusted farmers\u2019 suicide rate for 2011 is in fact slightly higher than it was in 2001.\u201d And that\u2019s after heavy data fudging at the State level. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nFive States account for two-thirds of all farm suicides in the country, as NCRB data show. These are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The share of these \u2018Big 5\u2019 in total farm suicides was higher in 2011 than it was in 2001. At the same time, the new Census data show that four of these States have far fewer farmers than they did a decade ago. Only Maharashtra reports an increase in their numbers. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nNationwide, the farmers\u2019 suicide rate (FSR) was 16.3 per 100,000 farmers in 2011. That\u2019s a lot higher than 11.1, which is the rate for the rest of the population. And slightly higher than the FSR of 15.8 in 2001. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Maharashtra, for instance, the rate is 29.1 suicides per 100,000 farmers (\u2018Main cultivators\u2019). Which is over 160 per cent higher than that for all Indians excluding farmers. Such gaps exist in other States, too. In as many as 16 of 22 major States, the farm suicide rate was higher than the rate among the rest of the population (RRP) in 2011. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe data for 2011 are badly skewed, with States like Chhattisgarh declaring \u2018zero\u2019 farm suicides that year. The same State reported an increase in total suicides that same year. But claimed that not one of these was a farmer. What happens if we take the average number of farm suicides reported by the State in three years before 2011? Then Chhattisgarh\u2019s FSR is more than 350 per cent higher than the rate among the rest of the country\u2019s population. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn 1995, the \u2018Big 5\u2019 accounted for over half of all farm suicides in India. In 2011, they logged over two-thirds of them. Given this concentration, even the dismal all-India figures tend to make things seem less terrible than they are. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nTen States show a higher farm suicide rate in 2011 than in 2001. That includes the major farming zones of Punjab and Haryana. The average farm suicide rate in the \u2018Big 5\u2019 is slightly up, despite a decline in Karnataka. And also a fall in Maharashtra. The latter has the worst record of any State. At least 53,818 farmers\u2019 suicides since 1995. So how come it shows a lower FSR now? </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWell, because Census 2011 tells us the State has added 1.2 million farmers (\u2018main cultivators\u2019) since 2001. That\u2019s against a nationwide decline of 7.7 million in the same years. So Maharashtra\u2019s farm suicide rate shows a fall. Yet, its farm suicide numbers have not gone down by much. And a farmer in this State is two-and-a-half times more likely to kill himself than anyone else in the country, other than farmers. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nKarnataka, in 2011, saw a lot less of farm suicides than it did a decade ago. And so, despite having fewer farmers than it did in 2001, the State shows a lower FSR. Yet, even the \u2018lower\u2019 farm suicide rates in both Maharashtra and Karnataka are way above the rate for the rest of the country. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThese figures are obtained by applying the new farm population totals of Census 2011 to farm suicide numbers of the NCRB. The Census records cultivators. The police count suicides. In listing suicides, the State governments and police tend to count only those with a title to land as farmers. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cLarge numbers of farm suicides still occur,\u201d says Prof. Nagaraj. \u201cOnly that seems not to be recognised, officially and politically. Is the \u2018conspiracy of silence\u2019 back in action?\u201d A disturbing trend has gained ground with Chhattisgarh\u2019s declaration of \u2018zero\u2019 farm suicides. (That\u2019s despite having had 4,700 in 36 months before the \u2018zero\u2019 declaration). Puducherry has followed suit. Others will doubtless do the same. Punjab and Haryana have in several years claimed \u2018zero\u2019 women farmers\u2019 suicides. (Though media and study reports in the same years suggest otherwise). This trend must at some point fatally corrupt the data. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAt least 270,940 Indian farmers have taken their lives since 1995, NCRB records show. This occurred at an annual average of 14,462 in six years, from 1995 to 2000. And at a yearly average of 16,743 in 11 years between 2001 and 2011. That is around 46 farmers\u2019 suicides each day, on average. Or nearly one every half-hour since 2001. </p>", "date": "May 18, 2013", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/farmers-suicide-rates-soar-above-the-rest/article4725101.ece"], "location": "\nMUMBAI,\n", "keywords": ["Farmers suicide", "farm suicides", "National Crime Records Bureau", "NCRB census", "main cultivators", "farm population", "agricultural labourers"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Tankers and the economy of thirst"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nThirst is Marathwada\u2019s greatest crop this season. Forget sugarcane. Thirst, human and industrial, eclipses anything else. Those harvesting it reap tens of millions of rupees each day across the region. The van loads of dried-out cane you see on the roads could end up at cattle camps as fodder. The countless \u201ctankers\u201d you see on the same roads are making it to the towns, villages and industries for profit. Water markets are the biggest things around. Tankers are their symbol. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThousands of them criss-cross Marathwada daily, collecting, transporting and selling water. Those contracted by the government are a minority and some of them exist only on paper. It\u2019s the privately-operated ones that are crucial to rapidly expanding water markets. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nMLAs and Corporators-turned-contractors and contractors-turned-Corporators and MLAs are vital to the tanker economy. Bureaucrats, too. Many own tankers directly or <i>benami</i>. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Water commerce</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo what is a tanker? Really, just sheets of mild steel plate rolled into big drums. A 10,000-litre water tanker consists of three sheets of 5 ft x 18 ft, each weighing 198 kilograms. The rolled drums are welded together. These can be carried by trucks, lorries and other large vehicles, mounted on them in different ways. Smaller carriers transport cylinders of lower capacity. A 5,000 litre container can go onto the trailer of a big van. It comes all the way down to 1,000 and 500-litre drums that move on mini-tractors, opened-up auto rickshaws and bullock carts. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAs the water crisis deepens, hundreds of these are fabricated across the State each day. In Jalna town of Jalna district, there are about 1,200 tankers, trucks, tractors, auto rickshaws flitting about with containers of different sizes. They shuttle between their water sources and desperate sections of the public. The drivers bargain with clients on cell phones. However, the largest amount of water goes to industries that buy in bulk. \u201cThe tanker owners transact between Rs.6 million to Rs.7.5 million in sales <i>each day</i>,\u201d says Laxman Raut of the Marathi daily <i>Loksatta</i>. \u201cThat\u2019s what this single sector of the water market is worth \u2014 <i>in this single town</i>.\u201d Raut and his fellow reporters have tracked this region\u2019s commerce in water for years. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Tanker technology</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nContainer sizes vary. But in this town \u201ctheir average capacity works out to around 5,000 litres. Each of these 1,200 does at least three trips a day. So they carry in all some 18 million litres of water in 24 hours. At the going rate of Rs.350 per thousand litres, that works out to over Rs.6 million a day. The costs can go up depending on whether the use is domestic, or for livestock, or industry.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nScarcity drives the tanker economy. Tankers are being made, repaired, rented, sold and bought. One busy spot we hit <i>en route </i>to Jalna is Rahuri in neighbouring Ahmednagar district. It costs roughly Rs.30,000 to make a 10,000-litre tanker body here. It sells for twice that sum. In Rahuri Factory, a small industries area, we get a crash course in tanker tech. \u201cEach 5 ft x 18 ft sheet of MS Plate is 3.5 mm thick (called Gauge 10),\u201d explains Shrikant Melawane who owns a fabricating unit. He shows us the \u201crolling machine\u201d on which each plate has to be manually rolled. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cThe 10,000-litre one weighs close to 800 kg,\u201d he says. The three sheets of mild steel it requires cost roughly Rs.27,000 (at Rs.35 a kg). Labour charges, electricity and other expenses total a further Rs.3,000. \u201cIt takes a whole day to make one 10,000-litre tanker,\u201d he says. \u201cThis season has been busy. We\u2019ve made 150 (of differing sizes) in three months.\u201d There are four units like his within a radius of one kilometre, churning them out at the same pace. And 15 within a three-kilometre radius of Ahmednagar town, on the same job. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cThe biggest ones \u2014 20,000-litre tankers, go to cattle camps and industrial units,\u201d says Melawane. \u201cThe 10,000-litre ones go to the cities and big towns. The smallest ones I\u2019ve made carry just 1,000 litres.\u201d The little ones \u201care bought by small horticulturists. Mostly tiny pomegranate growers who cannot afford drip irrigation. They take these drums on bullock carts and I\u2019ve seen them do the watering manually.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>From wells, tanks, reservoirs</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo where\u2019s the water coming from? From rampant groundwater exploitation. From private borewells \u2014 some newly drilled just to exploit the scarcity. These could run out as the groundwater crisis worsens. Speculators have purchased existing dug wells that do have water in order to cash in. Some bottled water plants in Jalna town bring it all the way from Buldhana (in Vidarbha) \u2014 itself a high water-stress district. So the scarcity should spread to other regions fairly soon. Some are looting water from public sources, tanks and reservoirs. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe tanker owner buys 10,000 litres for between Rs.1,000 and Rs.1,500. He sells that quantity at Rs.3,500 \u2014 pulling in up to Rs.2,500 on the deal. If he has a captive source like a working borewell or a dug well with water, then his costs are even less. And close to nil if he is looting public water sources. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cMore than 50,000 (medium and big) tankers have been made across the State this year,\u201d says former Member of Parliament (and ex-MLA) Prasad Tanpure. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the existing thousands from previous years. So it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how many are in action now.\u201d Tanpure, a political veteran here, knows the water scene well. Other estimates place the new tanker numbers at one lakh. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nEven 50,000 new tankers would mean that fabricators in the State have done close to Rs.2 billion worth of business over the past few months. Of course, some have taken a hit on other fronts as \u201cconstruction work stands suspended. No grills, beams, nothing else,\u201d says Melawane. But there are also those jumping into this lucrative market. Back in Jalna, Suresh Pawar, a tanker-maker himself, says: \u201cThere are over 100 fabricators around this town. That includes 90 who had never done this work before but are doing it now.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Shelgaon village of Jalna district, farmer (and local politician) Deepak Ambore is spending around Rs.2,000 a day. \u201cI get five tanker-loads of water daily to my 18 acres, including my five-acre <i>mosambi </i>orchard. I have to borrow from a <i>sahucar</i>.\u201d Why spend so much when the crop seems doomed? \u201cRight now, just to keep my orchard alive.\u201d Moneylending rates here can be 24 per cent a year or higher. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThings are awful but not at their worst. Not yet. Many in Jalna have lived off tankers for years now. Only the dimensions of the crisis and the numbers of tankers have exploded. The worst is a long way off yet and it isn\u2019t just about rainfall. Except for some. As one political leader puts it cynically: \u201cIf I owned ten tankers, I\u2019d have to pray for drought this year, too.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\npsainath@mtnl.net.in </p>", "date": "March 27, 2013", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/tankers-and-the-economy-of-thirst/article4551597.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Water scarcity", "Marathwada", "Jalna district"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Over 2,000 fewer farmers every day"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nThere are nearly 15 million farmers (\u2018Main\u2019 cultivators) fewer than there were in 1991. Over 7.7 million less since 2001, as the latest Census data show. On average, that\u2019s about 2,035 farmers losing \u2018Main Cultivator\u2019 status every single day for the last 20 years. And in a time of jobless growth, they\u2019ve had few places to go beyond the lowest, menial ends of the service sector.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nA December 2012 report of the Institute of Applied Manpower Research (IAMR) \u2014 a part of the Planning Commission \u2014 puts it this way: \u201cemployment in total and in non-agricultural sectors has not been growing. This jobless growth in recent years has been accompanied by growth in casualization and informalization.\u201d It speaks of an \u201can absolute shift in workers from agriculture of 15 million to services and industry.\u201d But many within the sector also likely moved from farmer to agricultural labourer status. Swelling the agrarian underclass.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo how many farmers do we have?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nCensus 2011 tells us we now have 95.8 million cultivators for whom farming is their main occupation. That\u2019s less than 8 per cent of the population. (Down from 103 million in 2001 and 110 million in 1991). Include all marginal cultivators (22.8 million) and that is still less than 10 per cent of the population.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nEven if you count together all cultivators and agricultural labourers, the number would be around 263 million or 22 per cent of the population. (Interestingly, this reduced figure comes after a few big states have actually reported a rise in the total number of cultivators. Since 85 per cent of all marginal workers reported more than a 100 days work, this could possibly reflect the reverse pull of MNREGA, among other factors).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nBetween 1981 and 1991, the number of cultivators (main workers), actually went up from 92 million to 110 million. So the huge decline comes post-1991.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nHold on: aren\u2019t 53 per cent of the population farmers?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNo. That\u2019s a common fallacy. The over 600 million Indians <b>dependent on agriculture </b>are not all farmers. They are deployed in an array of related activities \u2014 including fisheries. This confusion is widespread and innocent.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nYet, there are also a few whose colossal ignorance leads them to dismiss the country\u2019s massive farmers\u2019 suicides as trivial. For instance: \u201cat least half of the Indian workforce is engaged in farming. This fact points to a much lower suicide rate per 100,000 individuals for farmers than in the general population.\u201d Note how easily those <i>\u2018engaged in farming\u2019</i> become <i>\u2018farmers!\u2019</i>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAs a notion it borders on the whacko. It goes: After all, 53 out of every 100 Indians are farmers. So our 270,940 farm suicides since 1995 are a low number on a population base of over 600 million. So low that we should be agitated over how the suicide rate in the general population can be brought \u201cdown to the levels prevailing amongst farmers.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNever mind for now the appalling moral position that a quarter of a million human beings taking their lives is hardly alarming. The Bhopal gas tragedy, the worst industrial disaster in human terms, claimed over 20,000 lives. But in this perverse logic, since that was less than 0.003 per cent of the then population, it is rendered meaningless. That position says more about its authors than about the suicides. It shows they are clueless about who a farmer is \u2014 and about what the data show.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIt shows even greater ignorance of who defines and counts a \u2018farmer suicide.\u2019 <b>The Census records cultivators. The police count suicides. The police do not read the Census.</b> Not for definitions, anyway.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Census groups the population into workers and non-workers. The latter would be infants, children, students, housewives, unemployed, aged and retired people. Farmers, or cultivators come under \u2018Workers\u2019 \u2014 <i>a huge category covering many varied groups</i>. Now rural workers account for close to 70 per cent of all workers. And rural workers consist of farmers, agricultural labourers and non-farm workers.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Cultivators (main workers) in the Census are barely eight per cent of the population as a whole. (That\u2019s after a two-decade secular decline in this group). The ongoing farm suicides \u2014 184,169 of them since 2001 according to the National Crime Records Bureau \u2014 are taking place on a smaller and shrinking base. Their intensity has hardly diminished. In most of the States accounting for two-thirds of all farm suicides, the intensity has likely risen.</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOf course distress affects a much wider population dependent on agriculture. (Farmer bankruptcies crush the village carpenter, and even play a role in weaver suicides). The sufferings of others are as real. It is not as if the agricultural labourer or non-farm worker is having a great time. Both sections have seen distress migrations \u2014 and suicides. (For that matter the owner of a small industrial unit in an urban city could be distress-hit). Their suicides are no less tragic. But it is vital to know <b>who officially gets counted as a farmer</b>. And who gets <b>listed</b> in the \u2018farmers\u2019 suicides. For that tells us more about the ongoing tragedy and gives us a sense of its awful scale.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nEverybody who works in the film industry is not an actor. Everyone in the educational system is not a student. And all those in the 53 per cent of the population related to the farming sector are not farmers. Even among those who are, only a limited group gets counted as such when police and governments make farmers\u2019 suicide lists. Cultivators are counted by the Census. Suicides are recorded by police stations across the country. The numbers collated by State governments. Very different approaches are involved.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Census considers someone a cultivator if he or she operates a piece of land \u2014 which they may or may not own; State governments and police count only those with a title to land as farmers. The Census records two kinds of cultivators: \u2018Main workers\u2019 and \u2018marginal workers.\u2019 The latter are more like agricultural labourers or non-farm workers since farming is not their main activity. A \u2018Main worker\u2019 in cultivation is someone for whom that is the major occupation for <i>at least half the year</i>. That group makes barely eight per cent of the population as a whole.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSuicides among the others in the agrarian world (within that \u201c53 per cent\u201d) won\u2019t be recorded as \u2018farmer suicides.\u2019 Try getting State governments and their police to do that! Even within the \u2018recognised\u2019 eight per cent, those whose title to land is not clear will not be listed as farmers\u2019 suicides, should they take their own lives. For instance, women and tenant farmers are routinely excluded. Even eldest sons running the farms \u2014 with the land still in the names of their aged fathers \u2014 would also be omitted.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nPolice and State governments run the suicide lists, not the Census. Nor does the NCRB, which has neither the vested interest nor the ability to fiddle that data. It merely collates what the State Crime Record Bureaus submit to it. Hence, the Chhattisgarh government could brazenly declare a \u2018zero farm suicides\u2019 figure in 2011. That after the State saw over 7,500 of them (by its own admission) between 2006-10. With all the fiddles in the data, the numbers and intensity remain appalling.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMaharashtra revels in such fraud. With close to 54,000 since 1995, the State has been the worst in farm suicides for over a decade. And even those numbers conceal major exclusions. They\u2019ve invented categories like \u2018Farmer\u2019s relatives suicides,\u2019 or \u201cnon-genuine\u201d suicides, in order to further trim the numbers. So the State governments and their police, have immense power in re-defining who a farmer is. Watch out for more and more States doing \u2018a Chhattisgarh\u2019 and declaring \u2018zero\u2019 farm suicides in coming months and years.\n</p>", "date": "May 2, 2013", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/over-2000-fewer-farmers-every-day/article4674190.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Farm suicides", "farmer population", "agricultural labourers", "Census 2011", "India farming sector", "Agricultural Census", "P Sainath"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["How the other half dries"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\n\u201cEvery apartment is a dream come true \u2014 the coronet that tops the king-sized lifestyle of true blue blood.\u201d So run the ads. Yup. The blue bloods do it big. Each apartment has its own private swimming pool. These are, after all, \u201csuper-luxurious, supersized designer apartments.\u201d The kind that \u201cmatch the royal lifestyles.\u201d There are also the villas the builders proudly announce as their \u201cfirst gated community project.\u201d And yes, each of them ranging from 9,000 to 22,000 square feet also offers its own private swimming pool. In yet other buildings coming up, the duplex penthouses will each have, you guessed it: private swimming pools.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThese are just in Pune alone. All of them with other amenities needing still more water. A small but proud trend \u2014 with the promise of more to come. All of them in regions of a State lamenting their greatest drought in 40 years. In Maharashtra, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan\u2019s view, one of our worst droughts ever. In a State where thousands of villages now depend on visits from water tankers. A daily visit if you\u2019re lucky. Once or twice a week if you\u2019re not. Yet it\u2019s as if there is no connection between the swimming pools and the drying lakes. There\u2019s very little discussion about it, for sure. As little as there was during two decades when the State rejoiced in the spread of dozens of \u201cwater parks\u201d and water-theme entertainment parks. At one point, a score of them in the Greater Mumbai region alone.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Major diversions</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAcross the drought-hit regions of the State, despair grows. Over 7,000 villages are drought or scarcity-hit. Officially. Thousands of others are also in a bad way but are not classified as drought-hit. Of those declared as affected, some will get a bit of help. The government runs water tanker visits for them. Thousands of others make direct deals with private tankers. Close to half-a-million animals are dependent on cattle camps. Distress sales of cattle go on briskly, too. Water in many reservoirs is below 15 per cent. In some it is close to dead-storage levels. But far more than the searing drought of 1972, this is a man-made one.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere have been huge diversions of water in the last 15 years to industrial projects. And to private companies also in the lifestyle business. To cities from villages. Blood has been shed over such transfers. As in Maval in 2011 when police fired on angry farmers, killing three and wounding 19 others. They were protesting the government acquiring their land for a water pipeline from the Pavana dam to Pimpri Chinchwad. The scale of water loss this implied drew thousands more into the protests as well. The State\u2019s response at the time was to book around 1,200 people for \u201cattempted murder.\u201d And for rioting as well.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nDeputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar also did his best to lock in the control of industry over irrigation. He even tried to amend for the worse, the already regressive Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act. One new clause on his agenda would have barred any challenge to water-distribution policies.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe trends in diversion for lifestyle-entertainment though, are not new. In 2005, a huge \u201cFun &amp; Food Village Water &amp; Amusement Park\u201d popped up in Nagpur (Rural) district. That, in a period of real water stress. The Fun \u201cVillage\u201d had 18 kinds of water slides. It also had \u201cIndia\u2019s first snowdrome\u201d along with an ice rink. It is not easy to maintain snow and ice in 47\u00b0 heat. That took huge amounts of electricity in a region seeing 15-hour power cuts. It also guzzled massive amounts of water.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Lavasa and agriculture</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis is also a State that added quite a few golf courses in the past decade or so. It now has 22, with more in the pipeline. Golf courses use huge amounts of water. This has often sparked conflicts with farmers in the past. Golf courses worldwide also use vast amounts of pesticide that can seep into and affect the water of others as well. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBesides, this is a State where we\u2019ve seen angry protests over the water soaked up by private projects like Lavasa, \u201cIndependent India\u2019s first hill city.\u201d Sharad Pawar has drawn applause for ticking off his own party\u2019s minister, Bhaskar Jadhav, for wasteful spending on a family wedding in a time of drought. But the Union Agriculture Minister has always been gung-ho about Lavasa. The project\u2019s website noted quite a while ago that it has \u201cpermission to store\u201d 0.87 TMC. That is \u2014 24.6 billion litres of water.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNo State has spent more money to create less irrigation. The <i>Economic Survey 2011-12</i> found that land under irrigation had gone up by just 0.1 per cent of land in a whole decade. Which still means that less than 18 per cent of cropped area in the State is irrigated. That\u2019s after spending tens of billions of rupees to produce many millionaires and very little irrigation. The major transfers of water to industry also come in a time of agricultural decline. (A 23 per cent fall in foodgrain in 2011-12 according to the <i>Economic Survey</i>.)\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nEven as foodcrop declines, fully two-thirds of Maharashtra\u2019s sugarcane is grown in drought-prone or water scarce areas. At least one Collector had called for sugarcane crushing in his district to be suspended during this crisis. The sugar factories there together use up to 90 lakh litres a day. Given the power the sugar barons wield, the Collector is more likely to be suspended than the crushing.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe water needed for one acre of sugarcane can irrigate 10-12 acres of foodcrops like <i>jowar</i>. More than half of Maharashtra\u2019s irrigation water goes to this crop which takes just six per cent of the cultivated area. Sugarcane requires \u201c180 acre inches of water.\u201d That is, <i>18 million litres per acre</i>. Eighteen million litres can meet the domestic water needs of 3,000 rural households for a month (That\u2019s based on a modest 40 litres a day per person). This in regions where the water table falls every year. That has not deterred Maharashtra from encouraging Rose cultivation \u2014 a very tiny trend but growing swiftly with the promise of more to come. Roses need even more water. They need \u201c212 acre inches.\u201d Which is \u2014 <i>21.2 million litres of water </i>per acre. Indeed, rose cultivation, small as it is, has been a cause for some celebration in the State. Exports this year went up by some 15-25 per cent. The rupee\u2019s slide, an extended winter \u2014 and \u201cValentine\u2019s Day\u201d \u2014 gifted rose growers this happy situation.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn the last 15 years, the only regulatory frameworks the State has put in place lead to greater privatisation of water. To quicker loss of community control over this natural resource. One that is rapidly depleting. At the same time, the unchecked exploitation of groundwater has made things a lot worse. Maharashtra worked hard to get to the crisis it now faces. Private swimming pools amidst oceans of dry despair. For the rich, there is never a scarcity. For so many of the rest, their hopes evaporate by the day.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i>sainath.p@thehindu.co.in </i>\n</p>", "date": "February 27, 2013", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/how-the-other-half-dries/article4456130.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Maharashtra drought", "drying lakes", "water shortage", "water crisis", "Maharashtra irrigation", "crop failure", "water-distribution policies", "water parks"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Worshipping a steel rath in Orissa"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">They captured national attention during their nerve-wracking stand-off with the police barely a fortnight ago over the Orissa State's forcible acquisition of their land for POSCO. Today, Dhinkia and Govindpur villages seem, on the surface at least, quite relaxed.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThat,\u201d says Abhay Sahoo, smiling, \u201cis partly because the 24 platoons of police which came here to throw us out have been busy with the Jagannath <i>rath yatra </i>in Puri (where they beat up the priests). They were needed there for some days.\u201d Sahoo is the main leader of the POSCO Pratirodh Sangram Samiti (PPSS) that is fighting the land acquisition. Another reason for the lull, he says, is that \u201cafter they messed up in June, the Orissa government might worry about a new embarrassment. That too with a Parliament session just days away.\u201d Hence the pause in the conflict. Anti-POSCO villagers won the last round, both on the ground and in the media. But, as they see it, the police serve Lord Jagannath's wooden <i>rath </i>for only two weeks. \u201cTheir commitment to Posco's steel <i>rath </i>is round the year. They'll be back.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The returning police will meet a stubborn people. Quite determined to resist the State government's takeover of their farmland for the South Korean giant's proposed integrated power and steel plant and captive port. The project would also allow for the mining of 600 million tons of iron ore.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>The vineyards</b></p> <p class=\"body\">People here are among Orissa's better off agrarian communities. The betel vine (<i>pan </i>leaf) economy is central to their well-being. There are 1,800 vineyards in the project zone in official count. Betel farmers here put the number at 2,500. About a thousand of them in Dhinkia and Govindpur. The daily wage rate is Rs.200 or more plus a good meal. That's the highest in the State's agrarian sector, higher than what construction workers in Bhubaneswar get and close to twice Orissa's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) rate. It can go up to Rs.450 plus a meal for specific tasks in the vineyards. A tiny vineyard on a tenth of an acre can produce 540 labour days or more in a year. That's apart from 600 days of family labour. Some landless workers earn even more by being fishermen as well. That source of income collapses if POSCO's captive port comes up at Jatadhari. So locals mock the claim of projects bringing jobs, pointing to labour shortages and no major demand for employment. In all classes, even amongst traders, most are unwilling to lose their livelihoods for a project they find destructive and a compensation they see as meaningless.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Cases and warrants</b></p> <p class=\"body\">Below the calm surface is a larger tension flowing from the State's way of dealing with the anti-POSCO struggle. With multiple cases filed against large numbers of people \u2014 and countless warrants issued \u2014 several have been unable to go out of these villages for five years. \u201cMany can't attend close family weddings in other villages. They can't visit very ill siblings or parents,\u201d protestors at the \u201chuman wall\u201d guarding Dhinkia and Govindpur against police told us. This has fostered a state of siege feeling.</p> <p class=\"body\">Abhay Sahoo has 49 cases filed against him and spent 10 months in Choudwar Jail while fighting them. \u201cIn all,\u201d he says, \u201cover a thousand people here have had 177 cases filed against them for resisting POSCO.\u201d Trying to criminalise protesters seems a standard operating procedure in dealing with anti-displacement struggles in Orissa and beyond. Barely a hundred kilometres away in Kalinganagar is Rabi Jarika, leader of the tribal resistance to acquisition of land for a Tata steel plant. \u201cI couldn't leave my village of Chandia in years. The police had slapped 72 cases on me under every section you can name.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Jagatsinghpur district's Superintendent of Police S. Devdutt Singh attacks the PPSS' count as \u201cutterly false. There may be,\u201d he told us on the phone from Delhi, \u201c200-300 troublemakers against whom there are cases. Cases have also been filed by those harassed by the PPSS, including 52 families they drove out forcibly. And if there are innocent people fearing arrest if they step out, they may have been misled by the PPSS.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>2005 MoU</b></p> <p class=\"body\">Back in Dhinkia, Sahoo seems to be right about the present calm. While pouring rain was the reason advanced for a lull in the land battle, political embarrassment seems a more potent one. The latest is the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' asking the State \u201cto withdraw police forces sheltered in schools meant for the education of children\u201d in the project area. Critics point out that the government is forcibly acquiring land for a project whose memorandum of understanding (MoU) expired a year ago. The 2005 MoU between the State and the corporation gave POSCO the mineral at way below market prices. Top government sources say \u201cthe renewal is likely in 15 days.\u201d But the lack of an MoU has not stopped the State from moving to acquire 4,004 acres of land for the project. Roughly half of that is in Dhinkia and Govindpur.</p> <p class=\"body\">Priyabrata Patnaik, CMD of the Orissa Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation and the officer-in-charge of all land acquisition, declares: \u201cIt is not mandatory for us to have an MoU to acquire land. We have acquired and allotted over 9,000 acres for industries which have no MoU with the State.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The Orissa government Chief Secretary Bijay Kumar Patnaik told <i>TheHindu</i><i>,</i> \u201cWe are acquiring only government land. Most of it here is forest and we will not take private land (which is a small portion of the total).\u201d The vineyards,\u201d he insists, \u201care fairly recent.\u201d Villagers, however, point out that survey records show betel farms existing in 1927. \u201cAnd we have been here even longer,\u201d says Gujjari Mohanty at her vineyard. She is past 70 and has been \u201cengaged in this work from an early age.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Devdutt Singh asserts: \u201cOf seven villages in the project zone, things have moved smoothly in all except Govindpur and Dhinkia, where there is resistance. Even in Govindpur, I believe the majority are not with PPSS, only in Dhinkia they might be. Right now, we are clearing the work in the first five. Then we will go on to the others. There is no war here. We will do our job. But I cannot discuss how many platoons we have there or our plans.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">He is right that there is no war here \u2014 in that one set of combatants is totally unarmed. But when the police do move in on Dhinkia and Govindpur, POSCO's steel <i>rath </i>might run into that human wall. </p>", "date": "July 13, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/worshipping-a-steel-rath-in-orissa/article2221799.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Anti-Posco stir", "Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti", "land acquisition"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The feeding frenzy of kleptocracy"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nF<i>orbes</i> has just added an \u201cerrata\u201d to Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram\u2019s budget speech. The Minister had found a mere <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/only-42800-thats-rich/article4479458.ece\">42,800 people</a> in the country with a taxable income in excess of Rs.1 crore a year. Or $184,000 a year. <i>Forbes</i>, the Oracle of Business Journalism, does not list taxable incomes. But it does put up a list each year of billionaires the world over. And in 2013, 55 Indians figure on that list, (up from 48 last year) with an average net worth of around Rs.190.8 billion. (<i>See:</i> <i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\">http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/</a></i>)Their total net worth is $ 193.6 billion. That\u2019s\u2026er, Rs.10.5 trillion. Chidambaram might want to compare notes with Steve Forbes. They could come up with a lot more names falling within his narrow super-rich spectrum. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe 55 wonder-wallets give India fifth rank in the world of billionaires on the <i>Forbes </i>List. Behind only the U.S., China, Russia and Germany. Our rank in the 2013 United Nations Human Development Index, though, is 136 out of 186 nations. With almost all of Latin America and the Caribbean, bar Haiti, ahead of us. (We have, though, elsewhere managed to tie with Equatorial Guinea.) </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWell, okay, the total worth of our megabucks mob comes to just over $193 billion. But a glance within reveals a grim class divide. At the bottom are the <i>aam aadmi </i>tycoons, barely scraping past the one billion-dollar mark. There are four of them, inches away from plutocrat penury, with only a mere billion to their names. There are 17 in all below the BPL (Billionaire Permanency Line), which seems to be $1.5 billion. Once you cross that threshold, you tend to be a permanent member of the club. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere\u2019s another 12 in the magnate middle classes, between $1.5 and $2 billion. Next, the deluxe segment: 16 of them \u2014 above $2 billion, below $5.5 billion. And finally, the big boys \u2014 above $6 billion each. The top 10 are worth $102.2 billion. (A bit more than our fiscal deficit of $96 billion.) There is also a platinum tier. The top three account for a quarter of our total billionaire wealth, if <i>Forbes </i>is to be believed. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nI\u2019m not sure <i>Forbes</i> is to be believed. All these sound like grave underestimates. Meanwhile the Chinese and Russians have forged ahead of us on the List. (Steve, I demand a recount). Either the Chinese and Russians are up to no good, or Indian creative accounting is keeping our numbers down. This fiasco becomes particularly galling when we\u2019ve all been investing so heavily in the growth of our super-rich and better-off. Some $97 billion in this year\u2019s budget. You can express that as Rs.5.28 lakh crore (as our tables do). Or, as Rs.5.28 trillion. It\u2019s just as obscene either way. (<i>See: </i>Statement of Revenue Foregone <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2013-14/statrevfor/annex12.pdf\">http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2013-14/statrevfor/annex12.pdf</a>). Heck, we deserve a better performance from our billionaires. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nOne of the biggest write-offs in this year\u2019s budget is the customs duty on gold, diamonds and jewellery \u2014 Rs.61,035 crore. That\u2019s more than what\u2019s been written off on \u201ccrude oil &amp; mineral oils.\u201d Or even on \u201cmachinery.\u201d The waiver on gold and diamonds in just the last 36 months is Rs.1.76 trillion. (Or what we lost in the 2G scam). I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised, then, that three new Indian entrants to this year\u2019s Forbes Billionaires List are in the field of jewellery. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIt\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t been generous with them in other sectors, though. The latest write-off in corporate income tax is even higher at Rs.68,006 crore. The total revenue foregone this year (Rs.5.28 trillion), as others have pointed out, is greater than the fiscal deficit. But just look at what the write-offs on corporate tax, excise and customs duties add up to since 2005-06, from when the data begins: Rs.31.11 trillion. (That\u2019s well over half a trillion dollars). It also means we\u2019re writing off taxes and duties for the corporate mob and rich at a rate of over Rs.7 million every single minute on average. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBut the budget has almost nothing worthwhile for, say, health or education where there\u2019s a decline compared to allocations last year (in proportion to GDP). Ditto for rural development. And a micro-rise for food that will quickly be taken care of by prices. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nGee. It seems there\u2019s no need for the super-rich to commit half their fortunes to charity. They <i>are the charity </i>we all of us support. End the lavish waivers, pay your taxes and we\u2019d be in glowing fiscal health. Every other economic survey and/or budget has noted the obscene write-offs as a source of worry and said so. Recall that the Prime Minister and Finance Minister have both in the past promised to end this corporate feeding frenzy at the public trough. But it only gets bigger. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhat gets smaller is India\u2019s tax to GDP ratio. In Mr. Chidambaram\u2019s own words: \u201cIn 2011-12, the tax-GDP ratio was 5.5 per cent for direct taxes and 4.4 per cent for indirect taxes. These ratios <i>are one of the lowest for any large developing country </i>and will not garner adequate resources for inclusive and sustainable development.\u201d (<i>Emphasis added</i>) But he does nothing to correct that by way of raising revenue. Only by curbing expenditures in the social sector. He\u2019s nostalgic, though, for a time when \u201cin 2007-08, the tax GDP ratio touched a peak of 11.9 per cent.\u201d That was when the write-off trough was much smaller. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhat also gets smaller is the idea of food security in a nation where the percentage of malnourished children is nearly double that of sub-Saharan Africa. How do they get past the porcine gridlock at the budget trough? </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAlso getting smaller is the average per capita net availability of foodgrain. And that\u2019s despite showing an improved figure of 462.9 grams daily for 2011. (Caution: that\u2019s a provisional number). Even then, the five-year average for 2007-11 comes to 444.6 grams. Still lower than the 2002-06 figure of 452.4 grams. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIt\u2019s scary: as we warned last year \u2014 average per capita net availability of foodgrain declined in every five-year period of the 'reforms' without exception. In the 20 years preceding the reforms \u2014 1972-1991 \u2014 it rose every five-year period without exception (<i>see:</i> Table 3). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAh, but they\u2019re eating a lot of better stuff, hence the decline in cereals and pulses. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo drone on the Marie Antoinette School of Economics and assorted other clowns. Eating a lot better? Tell that to the nation\u2019s children \u2014 for whom sub-Saharan standards would be an improvement. Tell that to the famished in a country ranking 65 in the 79 hungriest nations in the Global Hunger Index (GHI). (Eight slots below Rwanda.) India\u2019s GHI score in 2012 was worse than it was 15 years earlier in 1996. Tell it to <i>Forbes</i>. Maybe they could do a list of the most insensitive elites in the world.

Landmarks he's fond of citing as foodgrain production rises every year. (Barring blips like those in 2009-10, of course). Sticking to absolute numbers helps him maintain a modest silence on another record he's been a big part of. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe daily per capita net availability of foodgrain has been falling steadily and dangerously during the \u201creform\u201d years. If we take five-year averages for those years from 1992 to 2010 \u2014 <i>the figure declined every five years without exception </i>(<b>see table \u201cDeclining per capita \u2026\u201d</b>). From 474.9 grams of cereals and pulses for the years of 1992-96 to 440.4 grams for the period 2007-2010 (The 2011 figure is yet to come). A fall of 7.3 per cent. There has not been a single five-year period that saw an upward blip. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhat about the 20 years preceding the reforms? That is 1972-1991? The per capita availability figure <i>rose every five-year period without exception</i>. From 433.7 for 1972-76, to 480.3 grams in 1987-91. An increase of 10.7 per cent. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Not reaching the needy</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nConsider the average for the latest five years for which data are available. It was 441.4 grams for the period 2006-2010. That's lower than the corresponding period half a century ago. It was 446.9 for the years 1956-60. Not great news for a nation where malnutrition among children under five is nearly double that of Sub-Saharan Africa's. (A point the India Human Development Report 2011 \u2014 from a wing of the Planning Commission \u2014 concedes). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIf production is rising, which it is; if the upper classes are eating a lot better, which they are; and if per capita availability keeps declining, which it does \u2014 that implies three things at least. That foodgrain is not getting to those who most need it. That the gap between those eating more and those eating less is worsening. And that food prices and incomes of the poor are less and less in sync. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIt also tells us how disastrous the reforms-era policy of \u201ctargeting\u201d through the Public Distribution System has been. The poor have not gained from \u201ctargeting\u201d in the PDS. They have been the targets. The \u201creforms\u201d period has seen more poor and hungry people shut out of the PDS in practice. The latest budget suggests that \u201ctargeting\u201d is about to get more ruthless. A universal PDS covering all would cost much less than what the government gives away each year in concessions to the corporate sector. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nSmall wonder that Mr. Pawar sticks to aggregate numbers in his claims of records. He stays with production in absolute numbers, because that's rising. As the Big Boss of Cricket in India (and the planet) Mr. Pawar would not be satisfied with totalling up how many runs a batsman of his makes. He'd divide it by the number of innings the batter has played. He'd perhaps even look at the number of balls he faced, strike rate and so on. But when it comes to his boss role on foodgrain, aggregate figures will do. The big numbers look so nice. Why complicate things by looking at how much foodgrain is available per Indian? That too, per day or year? </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Economic Survey document</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nFor those worried about food availability, though, it matters. The highest figure for any year in our history was the 510.1 grams for 1991. Aha! Chalk one up for the reformers? Not really. The data are based on the agricultural year \u2014 i.e. July to June. So the 1991 figure corresponds to the production of July 1990 to June 1991. Manmohan Singh made his speech launching the reforms on July 24, 1991. And the average for 2010, after nearly two decades of \u201creforms,\u201d was 440.4 grams. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe decline across the reforms years has been dismal. Indeed, some five-year periods in this era compare poorly even with those in the pre-Green Revolution years. For instance, 2006-10 throws up worse figures than 1956-1960. All figures from 1961 are seen in the latest Economic Survey of 2011-12. (<a href=\"http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2011-12/estat1.pdf\">http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2011-12/estat1.pdf</a> See A22, 1.17. Last year's survey has data going back to 1951. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis, of course, is the point at which someone pops up with: \u201cIt's all due to the population. The poor breed like flies.\u201d Is it? The compound annual growth of population was much higher in pre-reform decades than it is now. But the CAGR for food production was always higher and ahead of it. Even in 1961-1971, when the CAGR for population was 2.24 per cent it was 2.37 for grain production. In 2001-10, the figure for population was just 1.65 per cent. But foodgrain production lagged behind even that figure, at 1.03 per cent. (For the growth rate in foodgrain, we have not taken 2010-11 into account. We have only advance estimates for that year and these can vary quite a bit from final figures). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn all the southern states the fertility rate is either at replacement level or even below it. And the population growth rate is falling everywhere in the country, and at quite a rapid pace. Yet, per capita availability has declined. So the population claim does not fly. There may be one-off years in which the growth rate of food production (or even per capita availability) gets better, or much worse. Hence, looking at five-year or decadal averages makes more sense. And the trends those show are awful. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis is a context where foodgrain production <i>per capita </i>is on the decline. Where, however, the buffer stocks with the government in fact show an increasing trend. So per capita availability is in fact declining at a faster rate. It means the poor are so badly hit that they cannot buy, or have access to, even the limited grain on offer. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>GHI ranking</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nTrue, this will invite yowls of rage from the Marie Antoinette School of Economics (or \u2018Let-them-eat-cake' crowd). For them the decline only shows that people now care less for cereals and pulses. They're eating much better stuff since they're doing so much better. So much better that we'd be lucky to reach Sub-Saharan Africa's rate of child malnourishment in a few years. Or improve enough in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) to challenge an upstart Rwanda in a few years. Presently we rank 67 in the GHI (out of 81 countries with the worst food security status). Rwanda clocks in ahead of us at rank 60. India's GHI value in 2011 was worse than it was 15 years before that in 1996. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWe've spent 20 years promoting cash crops at the expense of food crops. No one knows quite how much land has been converted from the latter to the former, but it would run to lakhs of acres. As food crop cultivation has grown less remunerative, many have abandoned it. As farming tanks across large swathes of the country, more and more land lies fallow. The owners have given up on the idea of making a living from it. Close to seven-and-a-half million people quit farming between 1991 and 2001 (and we still await the figures for 2001-11). Two decades of policies hostile to smallholders, but paving the way for corporate control, have seen public investment in agriculture crash. No surprise then that foodgrain production is \u201cgrowing\u201d only in absolute numbers but falling at an alarming rate in per capita terms. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>psainath@mtnl.net.in\n</b></p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b><i>A graphic carried with this story was corrected</i></b>\n</p>", "date": "March 22, 2012", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-food-the-bad-and-the-ugly/article3025560.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["PDS", "Agriculture Ministry", "Sharad Pawar"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Bribes: a small but radical idea"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nLet's get this right. The Chief Economic Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, wants a certain class of bribes legalised? And says so in a paper titled \u201cWhy, for a Class of Bribes, the Act of Giving a Bribe Should be Treated as Legal.\u201d The paper is up on the Finance Ministry's website: <a href=\"http://finmin.nic.in/WorkingPaper/Act_Giving_Bribe_Legal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://finmin.nic.in/WorkingPaper/Act_Giving_Bribe_Legal.pdf </a>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAnd the author, Kaushik Basu, modestly describes his contribution as \u201ca small but novel idea.\u201d And again, as \u201ca small but fairly radical idea.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe timing is radical. Something like a plan to make sailing less risky issued by the Chief Officer of the <i>Titanic</i> between the first and the second icebergs. (The Skipper being too busy trying to stay afloat in all that gushing floodwater from CWG, CVC, CAG, 2G, DB, Radia, cash-for-votes, WikiLeaks, illicit funds overseas, Supreme Court censures and more.) And with the country sick of corruption \u2014 a giant issue in the polls in States like Tamil Nadu.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere are \u201charassment bribes\u201d and there are \u201cnon-harassment bribes,\u201d says Dr. Basu. He is mainly concerned with the former. Consider an exporter who has fulfilled all formalities but \u201cis asked to make an illegal payment before getting a customs clearance.\u201d Or the bribe someone gives an income tax officer to get one's tax refund cleared. All these are \u201charassment bribes.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nDr. Basu's solution? \u201cThe central message of this paper is that we should declare the act of giving a bribe in all such cases as legitimate activity. In other words, the giver of a harassment bribe should have full immunity from any punitive action by the state.\u201d He does clarify that the \u201cact of bribery is still being considered illegal.\u201d But he is suggesting a change in law. He argues that the \u201centire punishment should be heaped on the bribe taker and the bribe giver should not be penalised at all, at least not for the act of offering or giving the bribe.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Chief Economic Adviser even says where bribery is proved in court, the bribe should be returned to the giver. At present, the bribe giver and taker share a \u201ccollusive bond\u201d since both have violated the law. Giving the former immunity, he says, will break that nexus. In his view, the changed law would incentivise the bribe giver to rat on the bribe taker, since he himself faces no punishment. Presto! A \u2018dramatic drop in the incidence of bribery.' As Dr. Basu proudly says: \u201cThe reasoning is simple.\u201d It is, actually, simple-minded.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Chief Economic Adviser dresses up these arguments for middle classes forced to make payoffs. For instance when a person allotted subsidised government land \u201cgoes to get her paperwork done ... she is asked to pay a hefty bribe.\u201d Yet, his law will in no way curb bribery where scarcity exists. For instance putting a child into school where seats are hard to get. Or even getting that flat or the land he speaks of, allotted. Raising the stakes Dr. Basu's way could mean the victims face heavier demands. After all, the bribe taker needs to be compensated for the higher risk he now runs. And there is no focus at all on government failures that lead to scarcity. Nor on priorities that gift the corporate sector over $103 billion in write-offs in just this budget. Nor on spending policies that cut food subsidies and punish the poor.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe idea of legitimising this culture is an obscene one. Bribery is systemic. To ask a people burdened with it to accept bribe-giving as legal is to demand they accept both corruption and the existing structures of power and inequity it flows from. This is a perverse idea. And it is nowhere as \u201cnovel\u201d as he makes it out to be. As early as the 1960s, Gunnar Myrdal trashed such claptrap for seeking to create \u201cresignation and fatalism\u201d amongst the poor and less privileged. And for projecting such \u201casocial behaviour\u201d as normal. Decades ago, debates on this idea ended up acknowledging how morally corroding such practices were. But I guess with a government as embroiled in corruption as the one he advises, there's a need to exhume the corpse of that argument and dress it up as \u201cnovel.\u201d Dr. Basu dolls up corruption \u2014 for that is what bribery is \u2014 at precisely the time the Indian people are showing their revulsion to it.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nDr. Basu's \u201csmall but fairly radical idea\u201d suits those who can pay. And devastates those who cannot. Those who can and do make payoffs are unlikely to upset a system that works for them. Where bribery is systemic, the \u201ccollusive bond\u201d of giver and taker will strengthen if this dishonest idea becomes a law.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nTake this assumption: \u201cUnder the new law, when a person gives a bribe, she will try to keep evidence of the act of bribery \u2014 a secret photo or jotting of the numbers on the currency notes handed over and so on \u2014 so that immediately after the bribery she can turn informer and get the bribe taker caught.\u201d Poor people taking secret photos with hidden cameras (available at the nearest malls) and subtle pens which mark notes so the bribe taker won't know? How dumb an idea is that? The assumption that bribe givers will ring the bell after the bribe ignores the realities of power equations in our society and assumes access to legal recourse. Where the giver is poor, Dr. Basu's law will favour the taker. Where the giver is rich, it will favour the system of bribery.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nConsider these situations:\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe perpetrators of the cash-for-votes scam that corruptly kept this government in power would walk scot free in Dr. Basu's law. (Maybe that's the intention?) Can you see them saying, \u2018hey, these are the MPs who took our cash?'\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhat if a 2G scamster says he felt legitimately entitled to spectrum and paid \u201charassment bribes?\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIt would be fine for candidates to buy off voters during elections. After all, it is the takers who are to be punished, even if they turn out to be a few million.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWill a person offering a bribe to a judge be punished if the latter reports it? If the judge accepts the payoff, will the giver report it?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nA bribe giver exploits the drug-abuse habit of an official. The drug peddler has full immunity from any punitive action by the state?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAn Indian agent of a foreign intelligence outfit successfully bribes Defence Ministry officials. Would that agency then say \u2018Aha! They accepted kickbacks?' Great! We lynch the officials and congratulate the espionage ring \u2014 which is also entitled to its money back.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThese situations would be brushed off by Dr. Basu as \u201cnon-harassment bribes.\u201d He asks: \u201cShould the bribe giver be given full immunity in such cases? The simple answer to this is a \u2014 no.\u201d Dr. Basu says, \u201cA full answer to how the law should treat such cases will have to await further analysis.\u201d However, he is \u201cinclined to believe that even in such [non-harassment] bribery cases ... the punishment meted out to the bribe taker should be substantially greater than on the giver.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIs he wanting a certain \u201cclass of bribes\u201d to be legalised or is he really asking <i>for the bribes of a certain class</i> to be okayed? It seems the latter. The companies behind the 2G kickbacks will do fine in Dr. Basu's law. Their conduct will have to \u201cawait further analysis.\u201d Dr. Basu half admits his scheme could leave public servants \u201cvulnerable to blackmail and false charges of bribe-taking.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nInterestingly, about half the references listed at the end of the paper hark back either to other papers by the author himself; to papers co-authored by Dr. Basu with others, to those by still others in books he has edited: or to papers by yet others citing him in the title. Modesty would surely be a small but novel idea here.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOther, clever ideas from Dr. Basu:\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis year's <i>Economic Survey of India</i> (referred to by cloying TV commentators as \u2018Kaushik's Survey') links inflationary pressures to financial inclusion of the poor. \u201cThis must not deter us from pursuing financial inclusion ...\u201d but we \u201cneed to be aware of all its fallouts.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn the middle of 2010, he favoured decontrolling of fuel prices \u2014 which would, he argued, help tackle the price rise, even if it \u201cmight raise inflation in the short-term.\u201d (<i>The Hindu</i>, June 14, 2010). Again, this came at a time when food price inflation was pushing past the 15 per cent mark. And even as the FAO was warning against rising food prices worldwide and the immense hardship they would bring. (In December 2010, the FAO's food price index touched a record high.) And India since 2005-06 has seen possibly its worst five-year period in terms of food price increases.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMuch earlier, Dr. Basu wrote a piece in <i>The New York Times</i> (November 29, 1994) titled \u201cThe Poor Need Child Labour.\u201d In it he explained, among other things, why he had once continued to employ a 13-year-old at his home. (Another small but novel idea?) Dr. Basu is also an expert on \u2018development' who has long argued against banning child labour.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nA \u2018small but fairly radical idea' for this government: can we get somebody who talks sense?\n</p>", "date": "April 20, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/bribes-a-small-but-radical-idea/article1712689.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Chief Economic Adviser", "bribes", "CWG", "2G spectrum scam", "WikiLeaks", "Finance Ministry"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Census findings point to decade of rural distress"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nIs distress migration on a massive scale responsible for one of the most striking findings of Census 2011: that for the first time since 1921, urban India added more numbers to its population in a decade than rural India did? </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAt 833.1 million, India's rural population today is 90.6 million higher than it was a decade ago. But the urban population is 91 million higher than it was in 2001. The Census cites three possible causes for the urban population to have risen by more than the rural: \u2018migration,' \u2018natural increase' and \u2018inclusion of new areas as \u2018urban.' But all three factors applied in earlier decades too, when additions to the rural population far outstripped those to the urban. Why then is the last decade so different? While valid in themselves, these factors cannot fully explain this huge urban increase. More so in a census in which the decadal growth percentage of population records \u201cthe sharpest decline since India's independence.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nTake the 2001 Census. It showed us that the rural population had grown by more than 113 million since 1991. And the urban by over 68 million. So rural India had added 45 million people more than urban. In 2011, urban India's increase was greater than that of rural India's by nearly half a million, a huge change. The last time the urban increase surpassed the rural was 90 years ago, in 1921. Then, the rural total actually fell by close to three million compared to the 1911 Census. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, the 1921 Census was unique. The 1918 Influenza epidemic that killed 50-100 million people worldwide, ravaged India. Studies of the 1921 Census data say it records between 11 and 22 million deaths more than would have been normal for that decade. There was also the smaller impact of World War I in which tens of thousands of Indian soldiers died as cannon fodder for Imperial Britain in Europe and elsewhere. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIf Influenza left its fatal imprint on the 1921 enumeration, the story behind the numbers of the 2011 Census speaks of another tragedy: the collapse of millions of livelihoods in agriculture and its related occupations. And the ongoing, despair-driven exodus that this sparked in the countryside. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe 2011 Census captures only the tip of an iceberg in terms of rural upheaval. The last time urban India added more numbers to its population than rural India was 90 years ago and that followed giant calamities in public health and war. Yet, without such conditions, urban India added 91 million to its 2001 total, against rural India's 90.6 million. (<b>Table 1</b>). Nor can this reversal be fully captured by the factors Census 2011 cites as driving the urban increase. Take \u2018migration.' In public debate, \u2018urban' is often equated with big metros. This conjures images of massive waves of people from villages heading straight for the big metros. And this flow, you will be assured, is falling. (Vital data on this will emerge only next year and might surprise us).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Census data, however, do not convey the harshness and pain of the millions trapped in \u201cfootloose\u201d migrations. That is, the desperate search for work driving poorer people in many directions without a clear final destination. Like Oriya migrants who work some weeks in Raipur. Then a couple of months at brick kilns in Andhra Pradesh. Then at construction sites in diverse towns in Maharashtra. Their hunger, and contractor, drive them to any place where there is work, however brief. There are rural migrations to both metros and non-metro urban areas. To towns and smaller cities. There are also rural to rural migrations. There are urban-urban migrations. And even, in smaller measure, urban to rural migrations. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Flight from agriculture</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNeither the Census nor the National Sample Survey is geared to capture the complexity of India's migrations. A migrant in the Census is someone counted at a place other than his or her last place of residence. This records a single move \u2014 not multiple migrations. So it sees only the tip of the mobility iceberg, missing footloose migrations altogether. What we do know from Census 2001 is of the flight from agriculture. Between 1991 and 2001, over seven million people for whom cultivation was the main livelihood, quit farming. That is a mind-boggling figure. It suggests that, on average, close to 2,000 people a day abandon farming in the country. Where do they go? Nothing in employment data suggests they get absorbed in decent work in bustling cities.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhat about \u2018natural increase' (the difference between the numbers of births and deaths in a population)? That does not explain the switch around in rural-urban increases either. Indeed, the rate of natural increase has declined in both rural and urban areas. Still the urban population and towns get bigger and bigger.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAs Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India Dr. C. Chandramouli puts it: \u201cFertility has declined across the country. There has been a fall in numbers even in the 0-6 age group, as a proportion of the total population. In fact, in absolute numbers too, this group (now 158.8 million) has declined by five million, compared to the previous Census. This would suggest migrations as a significant factor in urban growth. But what kind of migrations we can only ascertain or comment on when their patterns emerge more clearly. The Census in itself is not structured to capture short-term or footloose migrations.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWe also get an extraordinary picture when viewing what demographers call the \u2018Urban-rural growth differential.' The URGD is simply the difference between the rates at which rural and urban populations expanded in each decade. It is also a rough and ready index of the extent of rural-urban migrations. The URGD in the 2011 Census is 19.8, the highest in 30 years.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u2018Natural increase' does not then account for the growth in urban numbers. Certainly not for the 30 per cent rise in urban population in the States. Thousands of towns today have far larger populations than they used to have \u2014 but not due to natural increase. The reason is migrations on a massive scale. Rural folk still outnumber urban people by more than two to one. In the 2001 Census, rural family size (5.4) remained bigger than urban family size (5.1). Also striking, States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar show massive falls in growth rates in 2011. In the 2001 Census, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were \u201cthe two States with largest number of net migrants migrating out of the state.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe other factor cited by the current Census for the turnaround is interesting. \u201cInclusion of new areas under \u2018Urban'.\u201d The number of \u2018statutory towns' has gone up by a mere 241 since 2001. Compare that with the preceding decade when they rose by 813, or more than three times that number. (A \u2018Statutory town' is an urban unit with a municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee.)\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere is, however, a boom in the number of \u2018Census towns.' In the decade 1991-2001, Census towns actually declined from 1,702 to 1,361. In the 2011 Census, they nearly tripled to 3894. That is stunning (<b>Tables 2 and 3</b>). How did this happen? And what is a \u2018Census town?' This is a village or other unit declared as a town when: its population crosses 5,000; when the number of male workers in agriculture falls to less than 25 per cent of the total; and where population density is at least 400 per square kilometre.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAt the very least, this means the male workforce in agriculture has collapsed in thousands of villages, falling to less than a quarter of all workers. So the farm exodus continues. What might the 2011 data on cultivators show us when it is out late next year? It could show us that the numbers quitting cultivation since 2001 might equal or exceed the over seven million dropouts of the previous decade.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Next: Decadal journeys: Debt and despair spur urban growth</b>\n</p>", "date": "September 25, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/census-findings-point-to-decade-of-rural-distress/article2484996.ece"], "location": "\nMUMBAI,\n", "keywords": ["rural distress", "census findings", "Census 2011", "National Sample Survey", "migrant workers", "agricultural sector", "growth rates", "Urban-rural growth differential", "URGD"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Decadal journeys: debt and despair spur urban growth"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The re-classification of villages and towns, and the changes this brings to the nation's rural-urban profile, happens every decade. Yet only Census 2011 shows us a huge turnaround, with urban India adding more people (91 million) than rural India (90.6 million) for the first time in 90 years. Clearly, something huge has happened in the last 10 years that drives those numbers. And that is: huge, uncharted migrations of people seeking work as farming collapses. We may be looking at \u2014 and missing \u2014 this cruel drama in the countryside. A drama of millions leaving their homes in search of jobs that are not there. Of villages swiftly losing able-bodied adults, leaving behind the old, hungry and vulnerable. Of families that break up as their members head in diverse directions.</p> <p class=\"body\">Neither the Census nor the National Sample Survey capture the fastest growing human movement of all \u2014 footloose migration (That is, the desperate search for work that drives poorer people in multiple directions with no clear final destination.). They are not geared to record short-term, step-by-step movements. For instance, many of the two million Oriyas outside their State in any year fall into this group. Take those from the Bolangir or Nuapada districts. Typically, they might spend a month or two in Raipur pulling rickshaws. Then work two or three months at brick kilns in Andhra Pradesh. Then serve as construction labourers shuttling around Mumbai or Thane for a few weeks each (Where they are often used on the higher floors in risky scaffolding. Local labour would demand more for that.).</p> <p class=\"body\">Often, displaced farmers and workers simply move to towns and other places within the same State. As in Maharashtra or Andhra Pradesh for instance.</p> <p class=\"body\">True, the Census cannot capture these movements of labour. Yet, if it still shows us the urban-rural numbers it does, that suggests a giant drama we have not begun to measure. The urban population and towns are swelling. And the Urban-Rural Growth Differential (URGD) is at its highest in 30 years despite the population growth rates falling all around <b>(see Table). </b>The massive migrations have gone hand in hand with a deepening agrarian crisis. One that has also seen over 240,000 farmers commit suicide between 1995 and 2009, most of them mired in debt (<i>The Hindu</i>, December 27, 2010). All along, there have been non-official, fragmented and micro signals of the chaos. Easy to dismiss as anecdotal, but still there to see if we choose to.</p> <p class=\"body\">In the first half of the 1990s, there were just around three or four buses a day from Khariar in Nuapada district of Orissa to Raipur in Chhattisgarh. Now there are 11. Earlier, these buses mostly set out from Bhawanipatna (Kalahandi district headquarters) and went via Khariar to Raipur. Today they start out from more towns and reach much smaller places en route to pick up work-seekers. There have also been massive spikes in train travel to Raipur from and via this region. Both in the numbers of trains and passenger load. And a huge increase in informal \u2018van' and jeep services ferrying thousands across the border. \u201cWhat is left here to stay for?\u201d Bishnu Podh, a footloose migrant in Nuapada, asked me. \u201cAcross the border there is a chance of work.\u201d When Raipur emerged as a State capital, the human flow became a flood.</p> <p class=\"body\">In 1994, there were few or no Kerala state transport corporation buses between Mananthavady in Wayanad district of Kerala and Kutta town in Karnataka. Till the farm crisis struck, cash-crop rich Wayanad had been a district of <i>in-migration</i>. So much so that it was called the \u201cGulf of Kerala.\u201d By 2004, the KSRTC was running 24 trips daily between the two towns. \u201cAll work in Wayanad has come to a standstill,\u201d Shinoj Thomas, a migrant that year, told me aboard a bus. \u201cJust see the countless half-built houses in the district. These were begun when farming was doing well. Once the crisis came along, construction ceased. No one had any money to continue\u201d. (<i>The Hindu</i>, December 26, 2004)</p> <p class=\"body\">In 1993, there was barely one full service a week from the Mahbubnagar bus depot in the Telangana region to Mumbai. Ten years later there were around 40. (Not counting private, fly-by-night operators). \u201cWithout Mumbai and Pune we cannot survive,\u201d Pandu Nayak, an Adivasi migrant had told me on a bus. \u201cOur households are deep in debt. Our children, starving.\u201d By 2003, the travellers too had changed. Earlier, there had been mainly Dalits and Lambada Adivasis, mostly agricultural labourers. Now there were carpenters, potters, small and even not-so-small farmers. A poignant moment during a 2003 trip was seeing a once-bonded labourer and his former master, a farmer, on the same bus to Mumbai, both seeking work. Meanwhile, each year, tens of thousands displaced by projects and SEZs from Polepally to Polavaram land up in Hyderabad and the surrounding urban regions.</p> <p class=\"body\">The economic crisis of 2008 saw the closure of countless powerloom units in Gujarat. Yet in 2009, over 5,000 \u2018unreserved' travellers from Ganjam, Orissa, still boarded trains for Gujarat almost every day at the Berhampur railway station. These were and are mostly labourers migrating for work in Surat and Mumbai. \u201cOur employers [in Surat] know we have few options,\u201d says Ganesh Pradhan in Ganjam. There are no days off, no recess, and 12-hour shifts. \u201cWork is up, pay is down. The lunch break has gone\u2026we're losing money and strength\u2026. [But] it's not as if we know that things are much better anywhere else.\u201d The list of such examples from across the country is endless.</p> <p class=\"body\">Who are these migrants? From the late 90s, as the crisis began to bite, communities that had not resorted to migration before did so. The Dalits of Kalahandi in Orissa were migrants much earlier. From the \u201890s they were joined by Adivasis, milk-producer OBC groups and others. \u201cThe migrations of these past 15-20 years are overwhelmingly distress driven, footloose and often disruptive of the lifestyle, roots and family bonds of the migrant,\u201d says economist Dr. K. Nagaraj, professor at the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai. \u201cVery few of them gain in terms of acquiring skill and capital unlike those from the middle and upper classes. When the latter migrate, they usually make big gains in skill, capital and mobility in the jobs ladder.\u201d This exodus signals the ruin of petty production in the countryside.</p> <p class=\"body\">And yet, this great outflow of human beings from their homes in the villages is not spontaneous. A massive chain has sprung up of middlemen and labour contractors who gain heavily from this exodus and thus seek to organise it to their benefit. They supply labour at cheap rates to a variety of patrons \u2014 from town and city contractors and builders to corporations, including multinational companies. This not only helps depress the local wage, but also offers the patrons a pool of cheap labour that is desperate, unorganised, and thus relatively docile. The employers don't have to bother about the migrants' security, workplace conditions or any standard benefits a city labourer might know of and claim. To the workers, this system offers quick if low payments, crushing debt and unending despair.</p>", "date": "September 26, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/decadal-journeys-debt-and-despair-spur-urban-growth/article2487670.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["agrarian crisis", "urban India", "rural India", "Census 2011", "migration"]}

That vital files keep vanishing has not helped the baffled sleuths in their task. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nLast week, the BombayHigh Court said Vilasrao Deshmukh \u201cclearly misused his official position as a Chief Minister of a State.\u201d This was in connection with a deal struck by the Maharashtra Film, Stage and Cultural Development Corporation while he was Chief Minister. The deal, a \u201cjoint venture,\u201d gave Subhash Ghai's film training institute, Whistling Woods, possession of 20 acres of prime real estate at rock bottom rates. \u201cWe clearly disapprove the conduct of Respondent No. 7 [Vilasrao Deshmukh] \u2026\u201d, said the court. It rapped him for the role he played \u201cin the entire proceedings leading to the signing of the JV agreement.\u201d The whole deal, said the outraged Court, was \u201cillegal, arbitrary and without authority of law.\u201d But Mr. Deshmukh's track record defies the laws of gravity, leave alone those of the nation. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn December 2010, Justice A.K. Ganguly of the Supreme Court admonished Mr. Deshmukh in scathing terms in the moneylender case. In his judgment, Justice Ganguly said he found the message it conveyed \u201cextremely shocking and it shocks the conscience of this Court about the manner in which the Constitutional functionaries behaved in the State of Maharashtra.\u201d (Justice Ganguly is no stranger to shocking things and was more recently on the bench which gave that historic verdict in the 2G scam). The judgment went on to say \u201cit is clear that the Chief Minister was aware of various complaints being filed against the said family [the moneylenders]. Even then he passed an order for a special treatment in favour of the said family which is unknown to law.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Moneylender case</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe judgment noted that Mr. Deshmukh's action \u201camounts to bestowing special favour to some chosen few at the cost of the vast number of poor people who, as farmers, have taken loans and who have come to the authorities of law and order to register their complaints against torture and atrocities by the moneylenders.\u201d And so Mr. Deshmukh set another record. It is hard to recall when a Cabinet Minister and former Chief Minister was punished and fined this way by the highest court of the land. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nPrime Minister Singh's response? He promptly elevated the man blasted for protecting moneylenders in his State to a portfolio that put him in charge of rural development across the whole country. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nClose to 30,000 farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra during Mr. Deshmukh's eight years as Chief Minister. That is more than half the total of 50,481 farm suicides the State has seen since 1995, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. It was in Mr. Deshmukh's time that Maharashtra emerged the worst State in the country for farmers' suicides. And that, for a decade without a break. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Farm suicides</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nBefore his reign began, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh were doing a lot worse in some years. Today, Karnataka, the State with the second highest number of farm suicides in the country, has a total that is 15,000 less than that of Maharashtra. In 2006, the height of the Deshmukh raj, his State saw 4,453 farmers take their own lives. No other State has ever logged a more heart-breaking figure. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBut the only blip on Mr. Deshmukh's record till 2008 had nothing to do with all this. He did lose his chief ministership for 22 months in 2003. But that, as his website puts it, was due to \u201cfactionalism in the state unit of the party.\u201d He bounced back stronger with the full backing of the Congress at the Centre. In the 2004 polls, he promised cotton farmers in both Vidarbha and his own Marathwada region that he would raise the minimum support price for cotton by Rs. 500. He did exactly the opposite on being elected, withdrawing the \u201cadvance bonus\u201d of Rs. 500 that cotton farmers were receiving till then. The move tanked prices, hit lakhs of farmers and saw distress sweep the cotton countryside. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nOn the farm suicides, Mr. Deshmukh saw himself as gentle and caring. As he told the <i>Hindustan Times</i> (October 31, 2007): \u201cCommitting suicide is an offence under the Indian Penal Code. But did we book any farmer for this offence? Have you reported that?\u201d He went down to Vidarbha to soothe the offended peasants, in the company of the redoubtable Mr. Vaghela. His healing touch came in a speech suggesting the farmers were lazy and less than honest and this was the cause of their problems. As outrage spread, he asserted he had been \u201cquoted out of context\u201d (<i>The Hindu</i>, September 15, 2007). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn his last three years as Chief Minister from 2005, the State lost 2 million jobs according to the economic survey of his own government. That is, Maharashtra lost on average 1800 jobs every single day. And that was well before the global economic meltdown struck in September 2008. (Oddly, the labour portfolio at the Centre wasn't given to him for this achievement. Or maybe it was and he turned it down as small potatoes. Maybe Prime Minister Singh's call now for more labour \u2018reforms' is a signal to him that this beat is his for the taking). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nNone of this, however, cost him the chief ministership a second time. He might even have survived the clamour for his head after the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. But Vilasrao thought it a smart idea to visit the terror-shattered Taj and Trident Hotels with his actor son and the Bollywood filmmaker, Ram Gopal Varma, in tow. Doubtless the tragic events threw up a rich vein of cinematic potential. Public outrage saw his party hand him the pink slip. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nA lesser man's career might have ended there. But Mr. Deshmukh is not a lesser man. His success mounts in inverse proportion to his achievements. After a brief sojourn nowhere, Mr. Deshmukh entered the Union Cabinet as Minister for Heavy Industry and Public Enterprises in May 2009. After the scathing Supreme Court judgment, he was made Union Minister for Rural Development. And in the last reshuffle, he became Minister for Science and Technology. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Cricket association president</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nHe is nothing if not versatile. While tackling the duties that portfolio imposed on him, he found time to get elected president of the Mumbai Cricket Association. He defeated cricket legend Dilip Vengsarkar to grab the post. Unlike the latter, his love of the game was more detached, less direct. Mr. Deshmukh has not played cricket at any significant level. (It is not known if he represented Babalgaon at the sport). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nHe also became the Minister for Earth Sciences (which, as often pointed out, is seen in his home State as jargon for real estate expertise). Jealous detractors say it is his raising this sector to the level of a science that makes him priceless to the Congress. But he is useful to them in many ways beyond this, for few are left in that party who understand the internal dynamics of its rivals in the State as he does. So where does he head next, now that the Bombay High Court has added another decoration to his war record? Chief Minister of Maharashtra? Watch this space. </p>", "date": "February 17, 2012", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-iron-laws-of-the-earth-sciences/article2900955.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Vilasrao Deshmukh", "Adarsh society scam", "Vidarbha farmers suicide"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Corporate socialism's 2G orgy"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">In six years from 2005-06, the Government of India wrote off corporate income tax worth Rs.3,74,937 crore \u2014 more than twice the 2G fraud \u2014 in successive Union budgets. The figure has grown every single year for which data are available. Corporate income tax written off in 2005-06 was Rs.34,618 crore. In the current budget, it is Rs.88,263 crore \u2014 an increase of 155 per cent. That is, the nation presently writes off over Rs.240 crore a day on average in corporate income tax. Oddly, that is also the daily average of illicit fund flows from India to foreign banks, according to a report of the Washington-based think tank, Global Financial Integrity.</p> <p class=\"body\">The Rs.88,263 crore covers only corporate income tax write-offs. The figure does not include revenue foregone from higher exemption limits for wider sections of the public. Nor higher exemptions for senior citizens or (as in past budgets) for women. Just income tax for the big boys of the corporate world.</p> <p class=\"body\">Pranab Mukherjee's latest budget, while writing off this gigantic sum for corporates, slashes thousands of crores from agriculture. As R. Ramakumar of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) points out, the revenue expenditure on that sector \u201cis to fall in absolute terms by Rs.5,568 crore. Within agriculture, the largest fall is to be in crop husbandry, with an absolute cut of Rs.4,477 crore.\u201d Which probably signals the death of extension services, amongst other things, in the sector. In fact, \u201cwithin economic services, the largest cuts are to be in Agriculture and Allied Services.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Even Kapil Sibal cannot defend the revenue losses as notional. For the simple reason that each budget sums up these numbers clearly in tables within a section called \u2018Statement of Revenue Foregone.' If we add to this corporate <i>karza maafi</i>, revenue foregone in customs and excise duty \u2014 also very largely benefiting the corporate world and better off sections of society \u2014 the amounts are stunning. What, for instance, are some of the major items on which revenue is foregone in customs duty? Try diamonds and gold. Not quite <i>aam aadmi</i> or <i>aurat</i> items. This accounts for the largest chunk of all customs revenue foregone in the current budget. That is, for Rs.48,798 crore. Or well over half of what it takes to run a universal PDS system each year. In three years preceding this one, the customs write-off on gold, diamonds and jewellery totalled Rs.95,675 crore.</p> <p class=\"body\">Of course, this being India, every plunder of public money for private profit is a pro-poor measure. You can hear the argument already: the huge bonanza for the gold and diamond crowd was only to save the jobs of poor workers in the midst of a global economic crisis. Touching. Only it didn't save a single job in Surat or elsewhere. Many Oriya workers in that industry returned home jobless to Ganjam from Surat as the sector tanked. A few other workers took their own lives in desperation. Also, the indulgence for industry predates the 2008 crisis. Industry in Maharashtra gained massively from the Centre's Corporate Socialism. Yet, in three years <i>before the 2008 crisis</i>, workers in the State lost their jobs at an average of 1,800 a day.</p> <p class=\"body\">Returning to the budget: There's also the head of \u2018machinery' with its own huge customs duty concessions. That includes surely, the crores of rupees of sophisticated medical equipment imported by large corporate hospitals with almost no duty levied on it. The claim of providing 30 per cent of their beds free of charge to the poor \u2014 something that has never once happened \u2014 is an excuse to dole out these \u2018benefits' (amongst others) to that multi-billion rupee industry. Total revenue foregone on customs duty in the present budget: Rs.1,74,418 crore. (Which does not include export credit-related numbers).</p> <p class=\"body\">With excise, of course, comes the standard claim that revenues foregone on excise duty translate into lower prices for consumers. There is no evidence provided at all that this has actually happened. Not in the budget, not elsewhere. (Sounds more like the argument now making the rounds in some Tamil Nadu villages that nothing was looted in the 2G scam \u2014 that's the money translating into cheaper calls for the public). What is clearly visible is that the write-offs on excise directly benefit industry and business. Any indirect \u2018passing on' to consumers is a speculative claim, not proven. Revenue foregone on account of excise duty in this budget: Rs.1,98,291 crore. Clearly more than the highest estimate of the 2G scam losses. (The preceding year: Rs.1,69,121 crore).</p> <p class=\"body\">Also fascinating is that the same classes benefit in multiple ways from all three write-offs. But how much does revenue foregone under corporate income tax, excise and customs duty add up to across the years? We have baldly stated budget figures for six years starting 2005-06, when the total was Rs.2,29,108 crore. To the current budget where it is more than double that sum at Rs.4,60,972 crore. Add up the figures since 2005-06 and the grand total is Rs.21,25,023 crore. Or close to half a trillion U.S. dollars. That is not merely 12 times the 2G scam losses. It is equal to or bigger than the Rs.21 lakh crore sum that Global Financial Integrity tells us has been siphoned out of this country and illegally stashed away in foreign banks since 1948 ($ 462 billion). Only, this loot has happened in six years starting 2005-06. The current budget figure for these three heads is 101 per cent higher than it was in 2005-06 (see Table).</p> <p class=\"body\">Unlike the illicit fund flows, this plunder has a fig leaf of legality. Unlike those flows, it is not the sum of many individual crimes. It is government policy. It is in the Union budget. And it is the largest conceivable transfer of wealth and resources to the wealthy and the corporate world that the media never look at. Oddly, the budget itself recognises how regressive this trend is. Last year's budget noted: \u201cThe amount of revenue foregone continues to increase year after year. As a percentage of aggregate tax collection, revenue foregone remains high and shows an increasing trend as far as corporate income tax is considered for the financial year 2008-09. In case of indirect taxes, the trend shows a significant increase for the financial years 2009-10 due to a reduction in customs and excise duties. Therefore, to reverse this trend, an expansion in the tax base is called for.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Rewind a year further. The 2009-10 budget says the same thing in almost identical words. Only the last line is different: \u201cTherefore it is necessary to reverse this trend to sustain the high tax buoyancy.\u201d In the current budget, the paragraph is absent.</p> <p class=\"body\">This is the government that has no money for a universal PDS or even an enhanced one. That cuts anyway meagre food subsidies from the largest hungry population in the planet. That, at a time of rising prices and a great food crisis. In a period when its own economic survey shows us that the daily average net per capita availability of foodgrain for the five year period 2005-09 is actually lower than it was in 1955-59 \u2014 half-a-century ago.</p>", "date": "March 7, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/corporate-socialisms-2g-orgy/article1514987.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["corporate income tax", "illicit funds", "foreign banks"]}

It was 62 per cent in 2009. Three of the Big 5 States have shown significant increases over 2009: Maharashtra (+269), Karnataka (+303), and Andhra Pradesh (+111). Nationally, the last eight years have seen on average, farmers killing themselves at a rate of one every 30 minutes. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn all, 14 of 28 States reported increases in 2010, while four have recorded declines of five or fewer suicides. The dip in 2010 comes with big falls in Chhattisgarh (-676), Tamil Nadu (-519) and Rajasthan (-461) and significant falls in Madhya Pradesh (-158), Puducherry (-150), and Uttar Pradesh (-108). West Bengal and Gujarat also report declines of 61 and 65. But the overall trend remains dismal. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn 1995, the first time the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) tabulated farm suicide data, the Big 5 accounted for 56.04 per cent of all farm suicides . In 2010, despite a one-year decline, they accounted for 66.49 per cent. Maharashtra's story is alarming. It saw 20,066 farmers kill themselves between 1995 and 2002. That stands dwarfed by the 30,415 farmers who took their lives in the next eight years. The latter period saw an annual average increase of nearly 1,155 such deaths in the State. This was also the period when money was poured into relief \u2018packages' of the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister, through the loan waiver of 2008, and other measures. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nDuring the very decade in which it reigned without break as the worst State to be a farmer in, Maharashtra rose to the first position among the big States in per capita income. Overall at Rs. 74,027, it is behind only much smaller States like Haryana and Goa. The Union Agriculture Minister is from this State and has held that post for six of those 10 years. </p>", "date": "October 29, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/maharashtra-leads-in-statistic-of-shame/article2577740.ece"], "location": "\nMumbai,\n", "keywords": ["farmer suicides", "NCRB report", "National Crime Records Bureau", "India agriculture", "agrarian crisis"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["No water under the bridge here"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Sarada Badre and her daughters have stopped their bi-weekly 20-km walking trips. That was their routine for a while. \u201cThe orange trees have withered and there's no water anyway,\u201d says Saradabai at her home in Sirasgaon village in Amravati district.</p> <p class=\"body\">In theory, watering their 214 orange trees shouldn't be too hard. Though the nearby canal has dried up, their new water source is 300 metres away. Next door by rural standards. \u201cBut that's 214 pots of water.\u201d Back and forth, that is 428 trips, half of them with a full pot of water on their heads. Or over 40 km for each of the three women \u2014 in short trips. They cover \u201chalf the trees on Mondays and the other half on Thursdays\u201d. That is apart from working in the fields all the other days with temperatures in Amravati well past 45\u00b0C in April itself. But now even that source is turning dry.</p> <p class=\"body\">Water in Vidarbha can be a mirage \u2014 and not just in summer. Many of its \u201cprojects\u201d in this sector remain on paper, though the money tied to them can be very real. Nearly Rs.3,000 crores of tenders have been floated for the Lower Penganga project \u2014 for which no land has been acquired other than 325 hectares for the dam site. \u201c16,000 hectares required, 325 acquired,\u201d scoffs a senior official. \u201cOf those tenders floated, Rs.2,400 crore worth appear to have been allotted and some Rs.600 crores worth are under consideration or up for approval.\u201d The region's landscape is dotted with \u201cprojects\u201d for which work orders have been issued but no work ever done. </p> <p class=\"body\">In Yavatmal, over 1,000 very angry people attended a \u201c<i>pani parishad</i>\u201d (Water Council) organised by the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS). The <i>parishad</i> declared it was fed up with \u201cthe total failure of government to address these problems\u201d. So <i>rasta rokos</i> and other protests against the severe water shortages are in the offing. That will turn up the political heat as well. In many places protests have also broken out over load-shedding running to 14 hours or worse \u2014 with little information given to the public. MSEB engineers have been roughed up by farmers in some places.</p> <p class=\"body\">Vidarbha's water crisis has half-crippled the Chandrapur Super Power Thermal Station which shut down the fifth of its seven units last week. The station now generates just 15 per cent of its capacity of 2340 MW. Such experiences have not deterred the state from proposing another 43 thermal power plants in the region. Around 19 of these have already been approved. \u201cWe live like there is no tomorrow,\u201d says one official.</p> <p class=\"body\">Panderkauda town in Yavatmal certainly lives that way. \u201cThey are pumping out 20 lakh litres of water a day from every known source and many new ones they've drilled into,\u201d says Kishor Tiwari of the VJAS. \u201cTheir bores now run very deep. Anyone but the municipal <i>parishad</i> can see this coming to a sudden dead-end with no chance of recharge or recovery. Water is being sought, bought, sold, even stolen. This is a quick route to disaster.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In Jarur village, Yavatmal, activists fought a politically-connected farmer selling water to poor people at high prices. That from a well which belongs to the village but with records fudged to show it as his property. He was selling ten litres for Rs.5. (Almost 150 per cent costlier than tanker water.) \u201cHe was earning Rs.1,000 a day from this,\u201d says one activist. While they managed to halt this, the well itself is nearly empty.</p> <p class=\"body\">And there is very little work when lots of people need it badly. Like in much of Maharashtra, Vidarbha's performance in terms of MREGS work remains dismal. In the entire Amravati division, where 10 million humans reside in five districts, there are just about 16,000 covered by the rural employment guarantee scheme. Of these, around 13,500 \u2014 84 per cent \u2014 are in Amravati district alone. Within Amravati, around 80 per cent of these workers are concentrated in just Melghat.</p> <p class=\"body\">Current attendance is worse in the other districts of the division, as official figures show. Yavatmal has some 950 workers on the MREGS. Washim around 680, Buldhana 480 and Akola a mere 440. Neighbouring Wardha, the sixth of the \u201ccrisis\u201d districts covered by the Prime Minister's and Chief Minister's \u201cpackages\u201d, has around 650. So there is very little work to be had here. \u201cWhen Bhandara district reached nearly 1,200 workers,\u201d mocks Mr. Tiwari, \u201cthat was presented as a success story.\u201d There is much hair-splitting over the factors behind this abysmal failure. \u201cLack of demand\u201d, is a common official claim, one activists challenge. Whichever way you cut it, Maharashtra's overall performance in MREGS lags far behind many other states \u2014 and gets worse.</p> <p class=\"body\">One result is a rise in out-migrations. \u201cAs soon as the agricultural season is over,\u201d says Sunita Nagulkar in Wadiraithad village of Washim, \u201cwe go to wherever the contractors call us. That could be Nagpur, Pune, Mumbai or other places. Though my husband and his two brothers own three acres jointly, it was never enough.\u201d In the places they went to, they faced harsh conditions but earned more than the maximum of Rs.105 each could possibly get if they were on the MREGS. All that came to an end this week. Her husband Chandraban had suffered an electric shock in the field that had damaged his arm. Depressed by that and their poor crop, he took his own life leaving Sunita to look after their three young daughters. But other \u201cmigrations are on and gaining in force\u201d, says Prakash Rathor, teacher and farm activist in Washim.</p> <p class=\"body\">In Sirasgaon, Akola, Saradabai shows little interest in the now stunted orange trees. In her, they evoke only the worst of memories. Her son Shekar took his life less than a week ago as their farm headed for its third straight year of failure. \u201cI don't care about it,\u201d she says, \u201cif the trees die.\u201d What she did care about, already did.</p>", "date": "May 4, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/no-water-under-the-bridge-here/article421031.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Vidarbha region", "water crisis", "Sirasgaon village", "MREGS", "Maharashtra government"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["WEF: Red Spider, Black Spider Redux"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The comforting thing about the sham wrestling \u2018championships' on television is that everybody knows they are a farce. Steroid-stuffed Cro-Magnons stomp the living daylights out of painkiller-primed Neanderthals. Good, unclean fun. The results are safely predictable. You should expect the 600-pound gorilla to overwhelm the 900-pound one in a staggering twist of fortune (after the bets have been laid). But the audience, the organisers, and the fighters all know the fighting is rigged and everyone's happy.</p> <p class=\"body\">There were many, pre-television Indian symbols of this honourable tradition. As school kids, we cheered wildly as Black Spider brutally crushed Red Spider's brother in an open-air bout. The roaring crowd dispersed only after Red Spider jumped into the ring to promise us he would throttle Black Spider in a revenge match the next week, so buy your tickets in advance. (He then toddled off to dinner with Black Spider). At age 8, it was magical.</p> <p class=\"body\">Decades later, television has given sham \u2018wrestling' giant audiences, made it more spectacular, but perhaps less convincing. (The close-ups are a dead giveaway). But almost everybody still knows what to take seriously and what not to. That, and the fact that they entertain more people, are what demarcate the world wrestling extravaganzas from the World Economic Forum. (Both, otherwise, fully corporate enterprises). The wrestling corporations take the money seriously. The World Economic Forum takes itself seriously, besides the money.</p> <p class=\"body\">The WEF's first ever summit in Mumbai ended on the 14th. Its main organiser was the Confederation of Indian Industry. But both the Centre and the Maharashtra government came out in \u201csupport.\u201d The Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Kerala (both States reporting rising farm suicides) hosted \u2018cultural evenings' and/or expensive dinners for this billionaires club, besides providing other forms of \u2018support.' The WEF's May 31 press release announcing Mumbai as the venue had this mysterious line: \u201cThe Summit will return to New Delhi in 2012 and 2014 in time for India's next national election.\u201d Wow, is the WEF running for office? And why shift from Delhi to Mumbai? Was it embarrassing for a government drowning in corporate corruption and scams to \u201chost\u201d the corporate world's Croesus Club in the capital?</p> <p class=\"body\">And so, the governments that cannot add a few hundred rupees per quintal to desperate paddy or cotton growers find the means to subsidise the global billionaire fraternity. Union Ministers and Chief Ministers came down to the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai to reaffirm support.</p> <p class=\"body\">But why? What exactly does the WEF deliver to India? Or anybody? Has it brought you staggering investments? Unlike the sham wrestling world, the WEF can predict nothing safely. (And they're hardly entertaining). When did this crowd ever get anything right? Did it warn you of the 2008 meltdown or the Euroquake? ( It did grimly observe in Mumbai that Europe is in trouble. Gee. The rest of us would never have suspected that).</p> <p class=\"body\">Dean Baker puts it so well: \u201cEconomic forecasters are not workers like dishwashers and cab drivers who are held accountable for the quality of their work. They can be wrong every day about everything and face little risk to their career prospects.\u201d (<i>CounterPunch</i>, August 25, 2011).</p> <p class=\"body\">However, by WEF standards, the Mumbai show was a bit subdued. The U.S. and Europe are reeling in crisis driven by the very economics the WEF stands for. India was still rising but not shining. Even the Planning Commission-driven India Human Development Report admits: \u201cthe average percentage of undernourished children under five years for 26 Sub-Saharan African countries was 25 per cent, about half the Indian average of 46 per cent. Weight and height of Indians on average have not shown significant improvement over the last 25 years.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">India's rank in the 2011 Global Hunger Index, at 67 out of 81, places us seven notches below Rwanda which apparently handles food security better. We're also below Sri Lanka (rank 36), Nepal (54) and Pakistan (59). The GHI 2011 states flatly that its data \u201cdoes not reflect the impacts of the 2010-11 food price crisis.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">And the country gracing the top five when it comes to dollar billionaires now ranks 134th in the 2011 U.N. Human Development Report. Our over 55 billionaires grew their wealth at an astonishing rate in the post-1991 era. And there's the India story: the consciously constructed, ruthlessly engineered inequality of it. Just see our HDI Value in the UNHDR. It reads 0.548. Adjusted for inequality, this value falls by close to 30 per cent. India's \u2018multi-dimensionally poor' now exceed 612 million, as the report shows us.</p> <p class=\"body\">But debates over India's dismal performance in giving its people the basic minimums always evade the policy framework of the past 20 years that has driven such levels of inequality. You can blame \u2018tardy implementation,' \u2018poor delivery,' anything \u2014 except the policies that have devastated hundreds of millions of poor Indians. And, of course, there is not even censure for the top guns and whizz kids.</p> <p class=\"body\">As Baker points out, for this kind of group, there are no bad consequences. If you think that disastrous failures would hurt their record \u201cthen you don't understand economic forecasting. There is no reason to believe that forecasters are any more knowledgeable about the economy today than they were four or five years ago.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Need a good Indian illustration of this? Take Planning Commission deputy chief Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Finance Ministry Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu and their multiple predictions on the economy, particularly on inflation. (Which, says CRISIL, forced Indians to spend close to Rs. 6 lakh crores extra in 36 months). With inflation close to double digits and food inflation at 10.63 per cent, they now admit, sort of, that we were, ahem, not quite as right as we are normally known to be. But we will, umm ... probably will return to being right in the near future.</p> <p class=\"body\">Dr. Ahluwalia even admits to credibility issues popping up. \u201cIt is true that we were hoping that this [moderation in inflation] will happen earlier, to that extent our credibility becomes a question.\u201d (<i>The Times of India</i>, Nov. 21, 2011). And straightaway makes another prediction \u2014 \u201cinflationary pressure would ease from the beginning of next year.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Dr. Basu believes it will start declining in December itself. If in February, says Dr. Ahluwalia, the data show that \u201cinflation is not coming down by then, then we really don't know what we are doing.\u201d India's human development indicators suggest they haven't a clue about what they were doing for 20 years. That, however, is not so. They knew what they were doing. Constructing a world based on a trickle-down, greed-is-good, inequality-helps philosophy. It made things much worse, though not for the authors of the mess.</p> <p class=\"body\">The WEF has gone. This time, it did not get the kind of publicity to which it is accustomed. Which brings us to the media. Who has been paying for, or heavily subsidising, the large contingents of Indian media that do the Davos Drool each year? Answer: Indian industry, which likes to have its cheerleading team along. Some of the rent-a-report crowd is from media outlets which will not spend a few thousand rupees to send a journalist to cover huge issues of hunger within the country. Switzerland is an expensive place. And Davos is at its costliest in the WEF season. Yet several Indian journalists seem to afford it.</p> <p class=\"body\">Quite a few have had their costs, including air travel and more, covered by industry lobbies, many of whose members are major advertisers and a big source of media revenue. There are newspapers that have given Davos summits far more coverage than they have the most vital bills before Parliament. There are channels that have had \u201cpartnerships\u201d with the CII and the WEF to cover Davos (always euphorically). Strong and rigid rules are issued to journalists on how to report. One such instruction: \u201cPlease note we cannot say \u201cWEF\u201d\u2026 it is the World Economic Forum and one is not allowed to call it otherwise.\u201d Wonder why? Does the acronym WEF sound too much like one of the sham wrestling outfits? Another fatwa from a television group: \u201cthe following programming from CII has to be incorporated in the programming of all channels.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Surely, the audiences watching the completely uncritical coverage of the WEF have a right to be told that the content was sponsored? When the funding is not clearly stated, when the content heavily favours the sponsor, when criticism is unknown, when correspondents are told how to fulfil their duties to their \u201cpartners' \u2014 this is what is called Paid News. But there is a pact of silence about this. A fine example of the kind of \u2018self-regulation' that media bosses have in mind?</p> <p class=\"body\">The organisers, lobbies, funders, the media \u2014 all know what's happening. But not, in this case, the audiences, readers or viewers. Where are you, Black Spider and Red Spider? All is forgiven, come home.</p>", "date": "November 24, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/wef-red-spider-black-spider-redux/article2653849.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["World Economic Forum", "Indian economy", "Global Hunger Index", "inflation", "price rise", "economic forecasts"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The high cost of some cheap weddings"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The irony was hard to miss. Political leaders \u2014 MPs and MLAs amongst them \u2014 lecturing people on the virtues of low-cost marriages. Divthana didn't need the sermon. This village in Buldhana district began its cheap, mass weddings way back in 1983. It has seen hundreds of brides married at very low cost to their families since then. That is, 23 years before the Maharashtra government launched its own mass-wedding programme as part of the Chief Minister's relief package for the Vidarbha region.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThe <i>netas</i> spend crores on the weddings of their own daughters but celebrate our austerity,\u201d scoffs one young villager. Divthana took no funds from government for its mass weddings. It has also convinced its people to have all the marriages in a given year jointly and on the same day. In a region where even the very poor might be forced to spend upwards of a lakh on getting a daughter married, this means a great deal. The cheap wedding practice has come from the dominant Rajput community that makes up most of the village. Which seems to give it a stamp of legitimacy, making it easier for more deprived groups around here to accept simple weddings.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThe normal wedding involves too many costs, too many feasts, too many guests,\u201d says Vishnu Ingle of Divthana. A stringer for major Marathi dailies like <i>Lokmat</i> and <i>Sakal</i>, Mr. Ingle's reports on the subject have helped make this village famous in the region \u201cToday 15 of our girls will get married and none of their families will pay more than Rs.7,000 for it,\u201d he says, proudly. He hands us the cheaply-printed joint invitation Divthana has put out for the event.</p> <p class=\"body\">Weddings have been an explosive issue in the region for some years now. Rising costs and dowry pressures have added to the ruin of many in six Vidarbha districts already battered by a decade-long agrarian crisis. Failure to get their daughters married has been cited as a factor in the suicides of some farmers and it is a major source of debt and stress for most. As early as 2006, this journal had reported the Maharashtra government's finding on the subject. \u201cWell over three lakh families had daughters whose marriages they could not arrange due to the financial crisis they faced. One in every nine showed interest in the mass marriage scheme of the Government.\u201d (<i>The Hindu</i>, November 22, 2006). That crisis has worsened a lot since then. In villages across the region, you can find many girls 25 years or older, unmarried because their parents can't afford it.</p> <p class=\"body\">So Divthana becomes important. \u201cWe prefer it this way,\u201d says Kalpana, one of the village's young brides in the most recent mass wedding. Her father, Rathor Singh Ingle agrees. \u201cThis is sensible and not wasteful.\u201d Other brides, their parents and even the bridegrooms we spoke to were for it. But what if better-off elements want to have their own, more upscale weddings? \u201cI was one of those,\u201d says Prabhakar Ingle who holds a steady job at a private hospital. \u201cBut friends in the village talked me out of the idea. I'm quite happy I did it this way.\u201d People around him are quick to point out that bridegrooms from other villages are also accepting it. \u201cOr how would we get our daughters married?\u201d they ask.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>An apolitical event</b></p> <p class=\"body\">The organiser of the wedding we are attending is the Hanuman Sansthan. This organisation has at least ten committees with over a hundred members to run the annual wedding day of the village. These include a \u2018dal committee' and a \u2018water committee'. The event after all, is a public one and draws many guests. \u201cWhat the girls' families contribute works out to no more than Rs.7,000,\u201d say Sansthan officials. \u201cThe rest is voluntary labour and help from villagers.\u201d The village has different political trends within, say Sansthan president Mansinh More and Divthana sarpanch Bhagwanji More. \u201cBut the Sansthan and the whole village act as one on social issues like the mass weddings. We see these as above politics.\u201d At least a dozen neighbouring villages now follow Divthana's example.</p> <p class=\"body\">And to this point, it's quite admirable. Success has many fathers, though. They're showing up in the form of more and more political bigwigs attending the mass weddings to harangue the gathering on simplicity. Local leaders can't afford not to be seen at them. As one activist put it: \u201cPolitical leaders engaging with the process is not a bad thing. This way the example reaches more people and gains legitimacy.\u201d The problem is when the process itself gets politicised \u2014 and hijacked. A fate that threatens Divthana's great effort.</p> <p class=\"body\">The math, for instance, no longer adds up. It is quite true that the families of the brides pay only a fraction of what they would if they held separate weddings. They avoid debt and possible bankruptcy as a result. However, as the annual wedding day event gains greater success, it is costing a lot more than it should. Some 15,000 people are at this wedding \u2014 many here because the political leaders are \u2014 and all of them were to be fed as guests. Divthana is spending a lot of money on its cheap weddings. To the point where it threatens to gut a fine example of simple living and joint effort. The poor families did not pay for the huge public event, but somebody did. Maybe rich political leaders. The idea of a village community taking charge of itself suffers. It also opens up a new chain of patronage. And converts somebody's wedding into a political event.</p> <p class=\"body\">The importance of Divthana's example can be seen in the suffering of many in other villages in this wedding season. Like struggling farmer Shekar Badre in Amravati who took his own life soon after learning his family had to raise Rs.1 lakh for his sister's wedding. Or of Bhagwan Hanate in Akola, who spent a fortune marrying off his first three daughters. \u201cThe wedding of my fourth daughter \u2014 I have five \u2014 broke down just days before the event. I simply could raise no more money to meet the demands of the other side.\u201d Sometimes, unmarried daughters of farmers who have committed suicide have taken their own lives \u2014 blaming themselves for their fathers' deaths.</p> <p class=\"body\">In a region ravaged by an ongoing agrarian crisis, costly weddings are sometimes the last straw. Divthana shows a way out of this. That is, if it does not become a victim of its own success.</p>", "date": "May 25, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-high-cost-of-some-cheap-weddings/article438391.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["mass weddings", "agrarian crisis", "Vidarbha", "farmer suicides"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["\u201cSeeing us, others will follow\u201d"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Getting 55 weddings done in 90 minutes flat won't rank as a record. Getting them done at no cost to the very poor families involved might qualify as one. That these are actually part of a successful Maharashtra government programme surely sets this up for a Guinness Book entry. The 55 couples in Nandura tehsil of Buldhana district are all Muslims. And there's a dual minority angle to it \u2014 18 of them are \u2018Adivasi Bhil Muslims' as the event's organisers call them. The ceremony is much like a civil wedding \u2014 except that the brides and bridegrooms take their vows at different venues. Ritual is at a minimum.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThat's it then,\u201d says Haji Muzameel Ali Khan of the Ashrafi Educational and Welfare Society, Nandura. \u201cNone of these families paid for the mass weddings as you can see and verify.\u201d We did. Mr. Khan, one of the event's main organisers, and his colleagues have overseen nearly 500 mass marriages in the past few years. The trend of having weddings that cut costs but retain dignity for a heavily indebted people is catching on in Vidarbha. The State government has spent Rs.33 crore on such weddings since 2006 \u2014 a fraction of what has been spent on utterly futile projects in the same six districts of this region since that year. It has covered 31,000 couples in a region of over one crore people. That works out to just around Rs.10,000 per couple. Which is very cheap in a time of distress, soaring prices, and a crippling farm crisis.</p> <p class=\"body\">It's the wedding season, and the number of mass marriages is growing. This is a very different picture from, say, 2006. The ones Mr. Muzameel Khan has helped organise stand out for their simplicity. There is no band, no blaring loudspeakers. \u201cEach family is limited to ten guests\u201d he says. \u201cBeyond that, they have to feed the guests at their own homes.\u201d The couples here are mostly from extremely poor backgrounds. Several are landless agricultural labourers doing any work they can find for a pittance. Or down-and-out weavers. \u201cMost of them,\u201d he says, \u201ccould not have afforded getting married. Poverty runs deep amongst Muslims here.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cI have had two of my three daughters married this way,\u201d says Durrani Habib Khan. He is a landless worker who shelled out Rs.30,000 for the marriage of his first daughter 20 years ago. \u201cThat could be at least Rs.1 lakh [or more] in today's money,\u201d says his neighbour Syed Shamsuddin.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cPeople have sold homes to get their daughters married,\u201d says Waheeda Begum, mother of Bilkees Anjum \u2014 one of the brides at the mass wedding. Her words capture some of the damage done by mounting wedding and dowry costs in Vidarbha. More so in six of its districts where lakhs have been ruined by the agrarian crisis. Where even the State government says three lakh families were unable to get their daughters married \u201cdue to the financial crisis they faced\u201d. This has been cited as a factor in the suicides of some farmers. And in a few cases, of their unmarried daughters as well. Weddings are a major source of debt and stress for most.</p> <p class=\"body\">Also remarkable at Nandura is the absence of political leaders exhorting the masses to lead a simple life. As the mass wedding trend has gained ground, there's a scramble amongst politicians to be seen as inspiring and leading the process. So the events get bigger, more unwieldy and lose focus. A recent event in Gondia saw tens of thousands of guests gather to see 300 couples wed. It also saw one of the brides die the following day, according to local newspaper reports, of sunstroke. But political leaders, minor and major, are eager to promote simple and austere weddings for the masses. Even Ministers who have conducted some of the costliest weddings ever seen in central India for their own daughters.</p> <p class=\"body\">At Nandura, though, there are no speeches, no sermons. Just a brief statement on the correctness of doing it this way. And then the rapid weddings of the 55 couples. Muzameel Khan himself is a district secretary of the Congress Minority Cell. But he does not cash in on this from the podium in ways so visible at similar functions. \u201cThis is serious,\u201d he says. \u201cEven now there are many marriages on hold or completely stopped in this tehsil. There are many unmarried young people past 25.\u201d It is also, \u201can interlinked problem. The farm crisis has seen weavers' incomes collapse as they lose their first market\u201d. His friend Syed Fahimuddin is hopeful: \u201cWith even the better off approving this mass wedding idea, it could spread quickly.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">How does the economics of this work? At some levels, it doesn't. \u201cWe do not draw a paisa from the Rs.10,000 the government gives each couple. That belongs to them,\u201d says Muzameel Khan. \u201cThe government provides Rs.2,000 per couple to the NGO that organises the event.\u201d But that's Rs.1.1 lakh, hardly enough for 55 couples. Muzameel Khan's extended family is very large and includes relatively well-off landowners. They and their close circle \u2014 \u201cwith no outside collections\u201d \u2014 raise another Rs.5,000 per family. So the average cost of each of the weddings is around Rs.7,000. There is, of course, a lot of voluntary labour.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, the costs, pressures and delays mean that the age of marriage is itself moving upwards. \u201cI got married around age 13,\u201d says Gunvanti Raut in Dhotragaon, Amravati. \u201cMy daughter wed at 18. Now, the girls are 23 or even older here. People struggle to get them married.\u201d While the changing age of marriage may not be a wholly negative thing, the accompanying distress surely is. Stories of people selling land, gold, cattle and other assets to meet wedding costs are endless. \u201cEven the very poor spend up to or over Rs.1 lakh, mostly by borrowing it,\u201d says Ajees Khan, father of bride Bilkees Anjum at Nandura.</p> <p class=\"body\">So the government's mass wedding programme and the initiative of groups like Muzameel Khan's hold promise. The brides, grooms and parents we spoke to at Nandura agree. \u201cSeeing us,\u201d says Waheeda Begum, \u201cothers will follow.\u201d</p>", "date": "May 27, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/seeing-us-others-will-follow/article439104.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["mass weddings", "agrarian crisis", "Vidarbha", "farmer suicides", "dowry"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Men of letters, unmoved readers"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Seeking authenticity for his letter to the Prime Minister and the President, Ramachandra Raut composed it with care on Rs.100 non-judicial stamp paper. Then he added a few more addressees, including his village <i>sarpanch</i> and the police, in the hope that it got home someplace. Then he killed himself. A mere digit in the nearly 250 farm suicides that hit Vidarbha in four months; but a villager desperate to be heard on the reasons for his action: \u201cThe two successive years of crop failure is the reason.\u201d Yet, \u201cbank employees came twice to my home to recover my loans\u201d. (Despite a government order to go slow on recovery in a region hit by crisis, crop failure and more recently, drought).</p> <p class=\"body\">Raut's suicide being the third in a month in Dhotragoan in Washim district, the village wants to see it spreads no further. \u201cWe try and meet every evening for an hour, all of us, anyone who will come,\u201d says Nandkishore Shankar Raut from Dhotragaon. \u201cThe idea is to keep people's morale up.\u201d So Dhotragaon counsels itself. Ramachandra Raut's letter was also an appeal not to be misunderstood. \u201cDon't trouble anyone in my home,\u201d it tells the police. \u201cI am fully responsible for my action.\u201d The stamp paper suicide note carries the seal of the deputy treasury officer of Mangrulpir tehsil dated March 29, and that of the stamp vendor who issued it to Raut on April 7. Raut filled it in and took his life the same day.</p> <p class=\"body\">The family owes the banks Rs.1.5 lakh. His village pooled money to observe his 13th day ritual, sparing Raut's indebted family further expense.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Unique</b></p> <p class=\"body\">Vidarbha's farm suicides have been unique in one respect. Some of those taking their lives have addressed suicide notes to the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister or the Finance Minister. In August 2006 Rameshwar Lonkar of Wardha complained, in his note, to Dr. Manmohan Singh, just a month after the Prime Minister went to his region. \u201cAfter the Prime Minister's visit and reports of a fresh crop loan, I thought I could live again,\u201d Lonkar wrote. But he found himself rebuffed at every stage while seeking that loan. Sahebrao Adhao's last testament in Amravati the same year painted a picture of usury, debt and land grab.</p> <p class=\"body\">In November 2006, cotton grower Rameshwar Kuchankar addressed the then Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in his note. He scribbled it down moments before taking his life in Yavatmal. \u201cWe are fed up with the delay in procurement and crashing prices ... Mr. Chief Minister, give us the price.\u201d He also warned State Home Minister R.R. Patil that if the price did not improve at once, suicides would soar. They did.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThese notes are the last cry of despair of people trying to tell their government the reasons for agrarian distress,\u201d says Kishor Tiwari. Mr. Tiwari heads the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, a body fighting for farmers' rights. \u201cWe set up expert committees to tell us why farmers commit suicide when they are themselves telling us the reasons with such clarity in their suicide notes.\u201d The notes often speak of debt, soaring cultivation costs, high cost of living and volatile prices. Some of them trash regressive policies and a credit crunch that have destroyed thousands of farmers here in the past decade. Crop failure and drought coming atop these, ruin fragile lives.</p> <p class=\"body\">Two years of crop failure in a single crop district can mean 34 months with no income. Vidarbha gained little from the 2008 Farm Loan Waiver which addressed only bank debt. The waiver excluded those farmers holding more than five acres, and made no distinction between dry and irrigated holdings. In Western Vidarbha, farmers take more loans from moneylenders than from banks. And, the average land holding is around seven acres in this mostly unirrigated region.</p> <p class=\"body\">Of the five states that account for two-thirds of all of India's farm suicides, Maharashtra is by far the worst. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) the State logged 41,404 farm suicides between 1997 and 2008. That is, more than a fifth of the national total of nearly 200,000 in that same period. Of those 12 years, NCRB data show, the years 2006-08 have been the very worst. Within the State, Vidarbha has been the focal point of the tragedy.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Back to square one</b></p> <p class=\"body\">However, the situation here seems like a throwback to that of 2005-06, before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit. Hit by a spate of suicides at the time, the State government spoke in many voices. In mid-2005, it gave out a figure of just 141 distress suicides across the whole State since 2001. Challenged in court, it revised this to 524. When the National Commission of Farmers team led by Dr. M.S. Swaminathan visited later the same year, it conceded there had been over 300 in the single district of Yavatmal. The final figure for the whole State that year, put out by the NCRB, was actually 3,926 suicides.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cFor a while,\u201d says Mr. Tiwari of the VJAS, \u201cthe State revealed real numbers on the website of the Vasantrao Naik Farmers' Self-Reliance Mission. That was because of Dr. Singh's visit and a lashing from the courts.\u201d In fact, those figures were far higher than anything even the VJAS had recorded. This year, however, the website's columns for 2010 are so far blank. The Agriculture Ministry's reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, based on State claims, says just 23 farm suicides occurred between January and April 8. This, even as other arms of government (and the Leader of the Opposition) put out figures ten times as high. The Vasantrao Naik Mission has itself given out signed data confirming there were 62 such deaths in January alone. (Though it has not put this up on its website.)</p> <p class=\"body\">The numbers are routinely lowered by tagging hundreds of suicides as \u201cnon-genuine\u201d. That is, \u201cineligible for compensation\u201d. Aimed at curbing the amounts the State has to fork out to bereaved families, this move has caused much damage. \u201cWe are deluding ourselves,\u201d says a senior official. \u201cNo wonder Ramachandra Raut felt the need to address his letter on stamp paper to the Prime Minister and President as well. He knew nothing would be taken seriously here in Maharashtra.\u201d</p>", "date": "May 5, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/men-of-letters-unmoved-readers/article422651.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Maharashtra", "Vidarbha", "P.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Some States fight the trend but \u2026"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nThe television story was genuine and sensitive. At least 90 farmers, it said, had committed suicide in two months in Andhra Pradesh. These were cotton growers. Actually, last year, Andhra farmers killed themselves at the rate of 210 each month on average, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. But it is heartening that somebody took note of what's going on. The more so when dishonest bureaucrats feed gullible sections of the press awful crud on farm suicides being at \u2018a 15-year low.' NCRB data show Andhra Pradesh has seen the <i>second worst increase</i> in farm suicides among all States (after Maharashtra) over the last eight years for which data exist.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, five States <i>did</i> manage a significant decline in the average number of farm suicides each year between 2003 and 2010. Andhra Pradesh was not amongst them. Of those who did, only Karnataka is amongst the worst five States which account for nearly two-thirds of farm suicides in the country. On average, 2,259 farmers killed themselves each year in Karnataka between 1995 and 2002. In the next eight-year period, that figure was 2,123 \u2014 a fall of 136 in yearly average. But the fall is fragile, and the last two years 2009 and 2010 have seen the State's numbers rising again. And Karnataka remains the second worst State for farm suicides (in absolute numbers) after Maharashtra. It has seen 35,053 farmers kill themselves since 1995, according to the NCRB.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe NCRB data on farm suicides now cover 16 years. Let's divide that into two halves of eight years each. By comparing the first half (1995-2002) with the second (2003-10), we can figure out whether things are getting better or worse in the major States.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhat qualifies as a significant decline? That's when a State's yearly average in the second eight years is at least 100 farm suicides less than in the first eight-year period. Tamil Nadu (-126) and Uttar Pradesh (-109) are two others in this bracket. But there's better. Kerala managed a drop of 221. And West Bengal pulled off the biggest decline among all States. Its 2003-10 average is 436 lower than its figure for 1995-2002.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nExcept Karnataka, all the Big 5 States show terrible upward spikes in their 2003-10 annual averages. The yearly average of farm suicides in Andhra Pradesh in this period was 711 higher than it was in 1995-02. In Maharashtra, the figure was 1,294 higher. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were one composite State for six of the 16 years and what has happened in that region is best understood by still treating them as one unit in terms of data. They show a rise of 525 in the second eight years.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nBut comparing the two eight-year periods doesn't work for the smallest States with very few farm suicides. For instance, Manipur's average for 1995-2002 was one farm suicide. It was two during 2003-10, a massive \u2018increase' in percentage terms \u2014 and quite meaningless. However, among small States that have seen farm suicides, Tripura brought down its annual average by 90 in the second half, a drop of 78 per cent.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe decline Kerala has managed (-221) is in many ways the most significant one. Kerala is perhaps India's most globalised economy. Its agriculture is hugely cash crop-based and fragile at the best of times. Cash crop prices are highly volatile, and often rigged by powerful corporations at the global level. This makes Kerala more vulnerable to price shocks than any other State in India. In the early years of the last decade, for instance, vanilla fetched Kerala farmers prices of up to Rs. 4,000 a kilogram. It then crashed to under Rs. 80 a kg or less (where it remains), wrecking farmers who had invested huge amounts of (borrowed) money in its cultivation. Most plunged into debt, several committed suicide in despair.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nPrice shocks have also hit Kerala in coffee, pepper, and other cash crops into which the State is deeply locked. The price of coffee, for instance, is controlled by about four major global corporations. These companies always seek to drive down the share of the original producers to boost their own profits. They will do that even more strongly as economic problems mount in Europe \u2014 to where much of our coffee is exported. Across India, suicides amongst cash crop farmers are far higher than those amongst food crop growers. Cash crop farmers run far greater risks, incur much higher cultivation costs, and have to borrow a lot more money than their food crop-growing counterparts.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo that drop of 221 in Kerala's yearly farm suicide average is remarkable and came against the odds. The period from 2008 to 2010 was better for that State than any other in the entire 16 years for which data are available. Kerala set up a debt relief tribunal in 2005, raised support to the farm sector and took other steps to mitigate distress. Even its troubled food crop sector received a boost. Between 2005 and 2010, Kerala doubled the support price for paddy from Rs. 700 to Rs.1,400. Yet, the State will take a worse hit than any other due to the multiple free trade agreements the Union government has signed or will enter. And reports of rising farm suicides again in the cash-crop citadel of Wayanad signal which way Kerala is now headed.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWest Bengal's (-436) drop in farm suicide yearly averages is perhaps best understood in comparison with Maharashtra. Bengal has a smaller population (91 million) than Maharashtra (112 million), but is a more rural State and has many more farmers. Yet, the annual averages are starkly different. During 2003-10, almost four times as many farmers (3,802) killed themselves each year in Maharashtra. In West Bengal that figure was 990. Though Bengal has its own sharp concentrations of cash crop, it produces more food crop than Maharashtra and has been the country's largest producer of rice for some years. In the latter, cash crops continue to overwhelm food crop. In 2010-11, as Maharashtra's Chief Minister informed his colleagues at a kharif review meeting earlier this year, the area under cereals and pulses dropped further by about 3.7 million acres. (<i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/agri-biz/article2054710.ece\">BusinessLine May 28, 2011</a></i>). West Bengal had, in fact, begun procuring grain through the panchayats (a scheme derailed by the Centre) and pushed other measures to promote rice and vegetable cultivation.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOverall, 15 of 28 States showed worse averages in the second eight years. Across the entire 16 years from 1995-2010, more than a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide.\n</p>", "date": "December 5, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/some-states-fight-the-trend-but/article2687160.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["farmers' suicides"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Food security \u2014 by definition"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nMaybe the government, the National Advisory Council and other assorted enthusiasts of the Food Security Bill can learn from Maharashtra about moving towards ending hunger altogether.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn 1963, the government of Maharashtra ended famine forever in the State. It did this without adding a morsel to anyone's diet. It did so simply by passing an Act in the Legislature that deleted the word \u2018famine' from all laws of the State. No kidding. This was called \u2018The Maharashtra Deletion Of The Term \u201cFamine\u201d Act, 1963\u201d (And was dug up after decades by an independent researcher from Bangalore.)\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe basis for this? Let the Act explain itself. It asserts that \u201cthere is now no scope for famine conditions to develop.\u201d Why so? Because \u201cthe agricultural situation in the State is constantly watched by the State government.\u201d And \u201crelief measures as warranted by the situation are provided as soon as signs of scarcity conditions are apparent.\u201d Goodbye Famine.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe next para says the term \u2018famine' \u201c<i>has now become obsolete, and requires therefore to be deleted</i>\u201d (emphasis added) from \u201cother laws on the subject in their application to the State.\u201d It decrees that \u201cfor the words \u2018famine or acute scarcity' the word \u2018scarcity' shall be substituted,\u201d in all laws of the State. Lucky Maharashtra \u2014 it can't ever have acute scarcity either.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nBy slaying famine and acute scarcity on paper, a government kills its own responsibility towards citizens, mainly poor and hungry ones, in times of crisis. Its burden becomes less. It can concentrate (especially in Maharashtra) on boosting the Indian Premier League and its billionaires.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis approach essentially defines a problem out of existence. You can't fight famine \u2014 so abolish it. It's a proud tradition the State still hews to. Can't stop farmers' suicides, so redefine who a farmer is. Then redefine what a suicide is. Maharashtra has done both. Why not have a law banning the word \u2018farmer' or \u2018suicide' or both? Solves an annoying problem in a State that has seen, in official count, over 44,000 farm suicides since 1995.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis is an Act in a State with a gosh-awful record in food production for years. That includes a 24 per cent fall in 2008-09. A rich State that has seen far more child hunger deaths than many poorer ones. A State that added greatly to its hungry with 2 million people losing their jobs between 2005-06 and 2007-08. That's over 1800 each day \u2014 and that's before the global meltdown of September 2008, according to the State's own economic survey.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe 1963 Act casts its shadow to this day. By legal definition, we cannot have a serious crisis in Maharashtra. So when there is one, we respond to it on a much lower scale than needed. No matter how deadly the crisis, relief work will never be up to the mark because it is not required by law to be so.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Union government and the NAC can learn from this. Why not just abolish the word \u2018hunger' by law? Replace it, maybe, with \u2018a mild craving for calories' (mild, not \u2018acute,'). Or words to that effect. End of hunger. We've started down that road. The NAC's idea of \u2018universal PDS in 150 districts\u201d is similar. It re-defines the word \u2018universal.' Death by definition has been routine for decades in India \u2014 consider the poverty line debates, for instance.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMeanwhile, say the \u2018experts,' the millions of tonnes of grain rotting in open yards present a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for India to export this in bulk \u201cand seize on the high prevailing global prices of grain.\u201d That is also what the government hopes to do. Its affidavit in response to a slap from the Supreme Court speaks of liquidating the excess stocks by open market sale (read exports).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nLeave aside for a moment the appalling insensitivity of exporting grain when there are, as the Supreme Court says, many \u201cadmittedly starving people\u201d at home. Just look at the logic of it. You have a gigantic pile up of grain. You have these admittedly starving people. You say the production is not enough to go for a universal system in PDS \u2014 even while boasting we have so much grain, we can cash in on high global prices. Remember that the government has bragged of \u201crecording the highest ever production of about 235 million tonnes of food grains in 2008-09 \u2026\u201d So much so that we cannot store half of it and it is rotting.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWho will you export it to? Are there good global prices for rotting grain? Grain that even when in best condition was not of superior quality? What you will do is flog it at rock bottom prices to traders who know you won't consider any other option \u2014 like letting the hungry eat it \u2014 and can knock your prices through the floor. And then the traders can export it as cattle feed \u2014 like India has done before in this very decade. About the only thing Iran and Iraq could agree on in 30 years was that the grain exported to them from India was unfit for human consumption. Both rejected shipments early this decade. But there are always, never fear, European cattle. Talk of sacred cows \u2014 these will be subsidised by some of the hungriest humans on the planet.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe government knows this is how it will end up \u2014 and is not at all averse to that happening. Apart from the juicy avenues of corruption it presents to many connected to the Food Ministry and the trader lobbies linked to them, it makes \u201csound economic sense\u201d in their worldview. One in which the hungry count for little. The National Democratic Alliance did the same thing in 2001-03 and paid the price for it in 2004. The United Progressive Alliance feels confident the elections are far off. And there are no pesky Leftists to restrain them in this innings. This is the time to ram through \u2018hard decisions.'\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMeanwhile, even as we talk of \u2018exportable surpluses,' we look around for ways to make up our production shortfall. Indian companies are buying land in parts of Africa to grow foodgrain. This finds approval with the Working Group on Agricultural Production set up by the Prime Minister and chaired by Haryana Chief Minister B.S. Hooda. Its report says \u201cWe should seriously consider these options for at least 2 million tonnes of pulses and 5 million tonnes of edible oil for 15-20 years.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIndeed, the Hooda report wants us to spread our net further. It says \u201cIndian companies can be encouraged to buy lands in countries like Canada, Myanmar, Australia and Argentina for producing pulses under long-term supply contracts to Indian canalizing agencies.\u201d (Thereby eyeing four continents besides Africa). So even as we convert more and more food crop land to cash crop or to non-farm use at home, Indian companies (doubtless with handsome government support) will buy land and grow grain in poorer countries (which is where it will mainly happen). Why? So we can create worse food crises in even poorer nations? But what if the locals get restless? They might resent the food they hunger for being shipped to India? No worries. What are we building a Blue Water Navy for, anyway?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nA dismal debate all around. Yet, in the next few weeks, the government, the NAC, Parliament, and the judiciary will all be called upon to take major decisions, even vital steps, on the food security of the Indian people. They might want to remember that there is existing legislation to draw from. Legislation far superior to and of a very different kidney from the \u201cMaharashtra Deletion of the Term \u2018Famine' Act, 1963.\u201d That is, the Directive Principles of State Policy \u2014 that give us the vision and soul of the Indian Constitution.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOf course, the moment we speak of the Directive Principles, up pops the point: \u201cbut these are not enforceable!\u201d Yet, the very line of the Constitution which says they are not enforceable goes on to say they are \u201cfundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply these principles in making laws.\u201d How the state \u2014 and others \u2014 perform their duties will be on display in the next fortnight.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWill the courts say anything about the notion of shipping grain abroad when millions go hungry at home? Will the government say something other than \u2018no' to the needs of the hungry? Will the NAC rethink its stand on a universal PDS? Will Parliament accept fraudulent definitions of food security? Will anyone speak for the Directive Principles of State Policy and how policy must work towards strengthening them? It would, of course, be silly to expect a government of this sensitivity to care a fig for the Directive Principles. But perhaps we can hope that the Supreme Court does?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Correction\n</b></p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>The last sentence of the second paragraph of the Edit Page Main article of the same day, \"Food security - by definition,\" referred to a 1963 legislation by the Maharashtra government.

The country has seen over a quarter of a million farmers\u2019 suicides between 1995 and 2010. The National Crime Records Bureau\u2019s latest report on \u2018Accidental Deaths &amp; Suicides in India\u2019 places the number for 2010 at 15,964. That brings the cumulative 16-year total from 1995 \u2014 when the NCRB started recording farm suicide data \u2014 to 2,56,913, the worst-ever recorded wave of suicides of this kind in human history. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nMaharashtra posts a dismal picture with over 50,000 farmers killing themselves in the country's richest State in that period. It also remains the worst State for such deaths for a decade now. Close to two-thirds of all farm suicides have occurred in five States: Maharashtra, Karnataka, A.P., Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe data show clearly that the last eight years were much worse than the preceding eight. As many as 1,35,756 farmers killed themselves in the 2003-10 period. For 1995-2002, the total was 1,21,157. On average, this means the number of farmers killing themselves each year between 2003 and 2010 is 1,825 higher than the numbers that took their lives in the earlier period. Which is alarming since the total number of farmers is declining significantly. Compared to the 1991 Census, the 2001 Census saw a drop of over seven million in the population of cultivators (main workers). The corresponding census data for 2011 are yet to come in, but their population has surely dipped further. In other words, farm suicides are rising through the period of India's agrarian crisis, even as the number of farmers is shrinking. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhile the 2010 numbers show a dip of 1,404 from the 2009 figure of 17,368, there is little to cheer about. \u201cThere was a similar dip in 2008, only to be followed by the worst numbers in six years in 2009,\u201d points out Professor K. Nagaraj, an economist at the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, who did the largest ever study of the farm suicides covering a decade (<i>The Hindu</i>, November 12-15, 2007). \u201cThis one-year decline does not in any way indicate we have turned the corner. This dip happened mostly because of one-off falls in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. In fact, a look at the \u2018Big 5' who drive the numbers shows the fallout of the agrarian crisis to be as grim as ever. They have actually increased their share of the farm suicides.\u201d </p>", "date": "October 29, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/in-16-years-farm-suicides-cross-a-quarter-million/article2577635.ece"], "location": "\nMumbai,\n", "keywords": ["farmer suicides", "NCRB report", "National Crime Records Bureau", "India agriculture", "agrarian crisis"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Drought of justice, flood of funds "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Sure, August is proving an unusual month. But what an extraordinary one July was! We celebrated the delivery of the cheapest car in the world and the costliest tur dal in our history within the same 31 days. And it took some work to get there. The price of tur dal was around Rs. 34 a kilogram just after the 2004 elections, Rs. 54 before the 2009 polls, Rs. 62 just after and, now at over Rs. 90, bids for three-figure status.</p> <p class=\"body\">The euphoria of July also saw Montek Singh Ahluwalia declare that the \u201cworst is behind us.\u201d (Though it must be conceded that he said that even in June and, possibly, earlier.) That\u2019s good. I only wish he had told us when the worst was upon us. It would have been nice to know. Otherwise, it gets hard to appreciate improvement. </p> <p class=\"body\">As a matter of fact, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar suggest that the worst could be ahead of us. And they don\u2019t mean the swine flu. Both appear to have written off much of the kharif crop. They advise us to buckle up for a further rise in food prices due to the drought they now say affects 177 districts. That they\u2019ve thrown in the towel on the kharif crop is evident in their calling for a more efficient planning of the rabi. Yet, the government had two months during which it could have opted for compensatory production of foodgrain in regions getting relatively better rainfall. But there was no effort at monsoon management. </p> <p class=\"body\">Even today, there are very useful things that could be done to counter the worst ahead. A positive step taken by the Rural Development Ministry now allows small but vital assets like farm ponds to be created on the lands of farmers through the NREGS. A pond on every farm should be the objective of every government. (Incidentally, this would help hugely with the rabi season. It would also ease the hostility of quite a few farmers towards the NREGS.) A massive expansion of the NREGS will also help cushion the lakhs of labourers struggling to find work and devastated by rising food costs. But it would call for throwing out the entirely destructive 100-days-per-household limit on work under the scheme. With the Prime Minister calling for anti-drought measures on \u201ca war footing,\u201d this should be the time to do it.</p> <p class=\"body\">The price-rise-due-to-drought warning is a fraud. Of course, a drought and major crop failure will push up prices further. But prices were steadily rising for five years since the 2004 elections, long before a drought. Take the years between 2004 and 2008 when you had some good monsoons. And more than one year in which we claimed \u201crecord production\u201d of foodgrain. The price of rice went up 46 per cent, of wheat by over 62 per cent, atta 55 per cent, salt 42 per cent and more. By March 2008, the average increase in the prices of such items was already well over 40 per cent. Then, they rose again till a little before the 2009 polls. And have risen dramatically in the past three months.</p> <p class=\"body\">The Agriculture Minister appears to have figured out that the stunning rise in the price of pulses may have little to do with drought. \u201cThere is no reason,\u201d he finds, \u201cfor prices to rise in this fashion merely on a supply-demand gap.\u201d He then goes on to find a valid reason: \u201cblackmarketing or hoarding.\u201d But remains silent on forward trading in agricultural commodities. Many senior Ministers have long maintained that \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d that speculation related to forward trading has had any impact on food prices. (The ban on trading in wheat futures was lifted even before the results of the 2009 polls were announced in May. And existing bans on other items have been challenged in interpretation.)</p> <p class=\"body\">The price rise since 2004 could be the highest for any period in the country barring perhaps the pre-Emergency period. For the media, of course, July was far more interesting for the political price in Parliament over the gas war between the Ambani brothers. When these two barons brawl, governments can fall. Also, how could atta be more interesting than airline tickets (the prices of which fell dramatically over several years)? Food prices might have gone up but airline travel costs went down and those are the prices that mattered. </p> <p class=\"body\">So the price of aviation turbine fuel became a far more to-be-covered thing as private airlines threatened a strike demanding public money bailouts. At the time of writing, it appears the government will try and make things cheaper for them. These airline owners include some associated with the IPL, which got crores of rupees worth of tax write-offs last year. Maharashtra waived entertainment tax on the IPL. And with so many games held in Mumbai that proved a bonanza for the barons paid for by the public. </p> <p class=\"body\">There\u2019s always money for the Big Guys. Take a look at the budget and the \u201cRevenues foregone under the central tax system.\u201d The estimate of revenues foregone from corporate revenues in 2008-09 is Rs. 68,914 crore. (http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2009-10/statrevfor/annex12.pdf) By contrast, the NREGS covering tens of millions of impoverished human beings gets Rs. 39,100 crore in the 2009-10 budget. </p> <p class=\"body\">Remember the great loan waiver of 2008, that historic write-off of the loans of indebted farmers? Recall the editorials whining about \u2018fiscal imprudence?\u2019 That was a one-time, one-off waiver covering countless millions of farmers and was claimed to touch Rs. 70,000 crore. But over Rs. 130,000 crore (in direct taxes) has been doled out in concessions in just two budgets to a tiny gaggle of merchants hogging at the public trough. Without a whimper of protest in the media. Imagine what budget giveaways to corporates since 1991 would total. We\u2019d be talking trillions of rupees.</p> <p class=\"body\">Imagine if we were able to calculate what the corporate mob has gained in terms of revenue foregone in indirect taxes. Those would be much higher and would mostly swell the corporate kitty for the simple reason that producers rarely pass on these gains to consumers. Let\u2019s take only what the budget tells us (Annexure 12, Table 12, p.58). Income foregone in 2007-08 due to direct tax concessions was Rs. 62,199 crore. That foregone on excise duty was Rs. 87,468 crore. And on customs duty Rs. 1,53,593 crore. That adds up to Rs. 3,03,260 crore. Even if we drop export credit from this, it comes to well over Rs. 200,000 crore. For 2008-09, that figure would be over Rs. 300,000 crore. That is a very conservative estimate. It does not include all manner of subsidies and rate cuts and other freebies to the corporate sector. But it\u2019s big enough.</p> <p class=\"body\">Simply put, the corporate world has grabbed concessions in just two years that total more than seven times the \u2018fiscally imprudent\u2019 farm loan waiver. In fact, it means that on average we have been feeding the corporate world close to Rs. 700 crore every day in those two years. Imagine calculating what this figure would be, in total, since 1991. (Er.., what\u2019s the word for the bracket above \u2018trillion?\u2019) Ask for an expansion of the NREGS, seek universal access to the PDS, plead for more spending on public health and education \u2014 and there\u2019s no money. Yet, there\u2019s enough to give away nearly Rs. 30 crore an hour to the corporate world in concessions.</p> <p class=\"body\">If Indian corporates saw their net profits rise in April-June this year, despite gloom and doom around them, there\u2019s a reason. All that feeding frenzy at the public trough. The same quarter saw 1.7 lakh organised sector jobs lost in the very modest estimate of the Labour Ministry. That\u2019s not counting the 15 lakh jobs said to have been lost in just the export sector between September and April by the then Commerce Secretary.</p> <p class=\"body\">And now comes the drought. A convenient villain to hang all our man-made distress on \u2014 and sure to oblige by adding greatly to that distress. A huge fall in farm incomes is in the offing. If the government wants to act on a war footing, it could start with a serious expansion of the NREGS (about the only lifejacket people in districts like Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh have at this point, for instance). </p> <p class=\"body\">It could launch, among many other things, the pond-in-every-farm programme. It could restructure farm loan schedules. It could start getting the idea of monsoon management into its thinking. It could curb forward trading-linked speculation that was driving one of our worst price rises in history long before the drought was on the horizon. And it could declare universal access to the PDS. That cost could probably be easily covered by, say, cancelling the dessert from the menu of the unending corporate free lunch in this country.</p>", "date": "August 15, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/drought-of-justice-flood-of-funds/article2853.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Drought", "monsoon", "deficit", "rain", "rainfall", "food security"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Till the cows no longer come home "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\u201cTruckloads of cattle have left this village,\u201d says Maruti Yadavrao Panghate in Devdhari village of Yavatmal. \u201cMany more will go. There is no fodder or water for them.\u201d Panghate, who owns five acres, feels he has lost \u201c80 per cent of my soybean, 70 per cent of cotton and 50 per cent of all the jowar I\u2019ve sown. Late rains even at this point will retrieve something, though not much. However, it could help with fodder and some water. Without that, the rest of the cattle will go, too. Already bullocks worth Rs.10,000 are selling at Rs. 4,000. It\u2019s the same in other villages.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The distress sale of cattle is one of the most sensitive indicators of crisis in the countryside. And when prices fall the way they have here, it suggests the onset of unusual levels of hardship. Vidharbha may not be yet as severely hit by the drought as parts of Marathwada or neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. But its situation is fragile. Its farmers have been battered by years of an agrarian crisis that had little to do with drought. Coming atop that crisis, monsoon failure hits a people far more vulnerable than they were in other decades.</p> <p class=\"body\">There is still a six to eight day loop, as Panghate says, in which late rains can save something. \u201cIt\u2019s been 20 days since the last showers,\u201d says Yavatmal\u2019s worried but energetic Collector Sanjay Deshmukh. \u201cAs things are now, we stand to lose about a fifth of the crop. If they stay this way and there are no further rains, we could lose up to 50 per cent of the crop.\u201d (Others fear higher losses.) Deshmukh is hopeful that late rains could keep that down to just a fifth. And he has opened fodder depots, released dam water strictly for drinking water purposes and activated new NREGs works. It\u2019s a race against time.</p> <p class=\"body\">The cattle sales continue, though. \u201cIf the drought gets worse, people won\u2019t keep any cattle at all,\u201d warns Hafizuddin Kabiruddin, one of the 15-odd agents or dalals at the cattle market in Panderkauda. \u201cI have not seen this kind of situation and I\u2019ve been 25 years in the trade. And mind you most of the sales are taking place directly at the village rather than at our cattle market. The trucks just pick them from the villages and move across the Andhra border to Adilabad.\u201d There, they go to the abattoirs.</p> <p class=\"body\">Hafizuddin explains why prices have fallen most on premium breeds. \u201cThe top breeds consume far more fodder than the others. Hence Jerseys worth Rs. 15,000 are going for around Rs. 8,000. High priced bullock jodis (pairs) which would have fetched Rs. 50,000 or more last year won\u2019t get you Rs. 30,000 now. You will also find that far more buffaloes are sold off than cows as they consume much more fodder than the latter. All varieties have fallen, but the nondescript ones had a low price anyway. So maybe those drop by Rs.2,000 or so.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of money for a poor family losing its milch animal. </p> <p class=\"body\">At the end of two hours of explaining the trade and its present situation to us, Hafizuddin reveals that he too has been hit. \u201cI\u2019ve had to sell nine head of cattle in the past month.\u201d Quite a few of those from premium breeds. He has lost around Rs.35,000 on those. He did not want to sell them, but \u201cwhere is the fodder?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWater, too, is a huge problem,\u201d says Amol Srirami whose family owns a well-known lassi shop in Panderkauda town. He and his brother Prashant have sold three of their five buffaloes in just the past eight days. \u201cWe lost a packet on that,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cThe lassi season is really for three months from about March to May. But you\u2019ve got to feed and care for the animals all 12 months. Less fodder translates into less milk, so there\u2019s no earning there either. I think each house in our Tadumri village has sold one or two head of cattle.\u201d And so the Prashant Ras Vihar and Lassi Centre stays closed \u201cfor the season.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Water, as Srirami says, is a huge problem for livestock as well. But typically, as one district official points out, \u201cgovernments in a time of crisis tend to focus only on drinking water for human beings.\u201d In a country with close to 600 million farm animals, that\u2019s a problem. \u201cFarm animals are not taken into account at the time of planning.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cYou can see that the cattle and goats are having to drink any water they can, a lot of it quite toxic, from contaminated sources,\u201d says Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti leader Kishor Tiwari. His organisation has been at the forefront of fighting for the rights of farmers in this region. \u201cIf the rains do not show in the next week,\u201d he says, \u201cwe are in serious trouble on every front. Crop, water and fodder.\u201d Water, confirm those selling off their cattle, is as much a problem as fodder. Oddly enough, lower level officials in some talukas deny there is a fodder crisis. They say all applications for fodder \u201chave been disposed off.\u201d This contrasted sharply with claims amongst villagers that they were unable to get any. \u201cPerhaps people have long ago given up seeking things from the administration,\u201d jokes Tiwari. But Collector Deshmukh is taking no chances on this front and opening fodder centres anyway. </p> <p class=\"body\">There is also the problem that over years, as in much of the country, the district\u2019s agriculture extension machinery is crippled. At some levels non-existent. \u201cOne-third of extension officers posts are lying vacant,\u201d says an official. \u201cThen there are so many vacancies in clerical posts as well. So many of those meant to do extension work are pressed into clerical duties. That means even fewer people in the field.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In a region already beset with problems, the soybean crop being hit by pest, the jowar (that could provide fodder) in danger and water getting scarcer, the next eight days will be crucial. </p>", "date": "August 19, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/till-the-cows-no-longer-come-home/article5165.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Sainath", "drought", "monsoon", "deficit", "rain", "rainfall", "food security", "Yavatmal", "cattle", "distress", "sale"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The Union Cabinet gets healthier"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Air India might not be doing as well we'd like it to. But the braveheart who flew it fearlessly into dense clouds of debt is doing okay. Praful Patel (who no longer holds the aviation portfolio) added, on average, over half a million rupees every day to his assets in 28 months between May 2009 and August 2011. This might be an understated figure since it is based on his own word. Ministers tend to be modest in these matters. But given the official data, the math is inescapable.</p> <p class=\"body\">In his 2009 poll affidavit, Mr. Patel said his assets were worth over Rs.79 crore. Let's assume he listed all he had up to April 2009, the polls being in May that year. Compare that figure with the more than Rs.122 crore that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) put up against his name online this month. Since this increase occurred in 28 months, my math says that averages over Rs.5 lakh a day. (I can add, though not at the speed of Mr. Patel.)</p> <p class=\"body\">Air India, meanwhile, struggles to pay salaries to its employees. Mr. Patel adds more to his wealth every day than each of 40 per cent of the airline's employees earns in a year. So while the airline might get grounded, he flies high. As an ex-Board for Industrial &amp; Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) chief said decades ago (of ailing private units): the sicker the units grew, the healthier the owners got. That crudely fits the state of the Indian poor in relation to their government. The worse off they become, the healthier the Union Cabinet gets. (Drag corporate bosses into the equation and it's more dramatic. But that's another story.) Patel was rewarded for services rendered. He was elevated to Cabinet rank as Minister for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises.</p> <p class=\"body\">The analysis of the Union Cabinet's assets, done as thoroughly as always by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and the National Election Watch (NEW), makes crisp reading. It's official. Trickle Down is pass\u00e9. Lift Irrigation, sending flows gushing to the top, is in. The average asset worth of a union minister rose from Rs.7.3 crore to Rs.10.6 crore in those 28 months. Adding a modest million a month on average through 28 months.</p> <p class=\"body\">Mr. Patel is the richest Union Cabinet member by far. But the DMK's Dr. S. Jagathrakshakan made a bold dash to fame. The Minister of State (MoS) for Information and Broadcasting's assets grew by 1,092 per cent to Patel's 53 per cent. According to the ADR's analysis, his assets went up from Rs.5.9 crore in 2009 to Rs.70 crore this year. But Patel, batting on 122, still tops the Cabinet Premier League. The DMK man might have worked up a scorching pace, but Patel's dug in for a good, long innings.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, the dashing youth brigade isn't doing too badly either. Young Milind Deora, MoS for Communications and Information Technology, almost doubled his assets between 2009 and 2011. He went from over Rs.17 crore to more than Rs.33 crore. Consider that his 2004 poll affidavit pegged his worth at Rs.8.8 crore. Adding almost a lakh every day on average for seven years and nearly quadrupling your assets in that time isn't so bad.</p> <p class=\"body\">On the face of it, Deora has outclassed Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar. Going by their declarations, Deora is two-and-a-half times richer than the mighty Maratha. He was richer than him even in 2009, but increased his assets by almost 90 per cent since then. Pawar failed to add even a paltry Rs.4 crore in the same time. Which means he clocks in at under Rs.12.5 crore, all told. A kindly account making the rounds in his home state is that Pawarsaheb was slightly confused over whether the declaration called for revealing his total asset worth or a statement of monthly income.</p> <p class=\"body\">Another modest performer is Minister of Science &amp; Technology Vilasrao Deshmukh. He's added a piffling Rs.1.73 crore since 2009. Mr. Deshmukh is also Minister of Earth Sciences. (A title seen in Maharashtra as jargon for Real Estate expertise.)</p> <p class=\"body\">Otherwise, the cricket caucus in Dr. Manmohan Singh's team is doing well. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and new IPL boss Rajeev Shukla added over Rs.22 crore in those 28 months to his total asset worth. That takes it from over Rs.7 crore in 2009 to more than Rs.30 crore this year.</p> <p class=\"body\">It's not just serving ministers who are thriving, though. Nor are the upwardly mobile confined to the Centre. As always, the bulk of the <i>Guinness Book </i>stuff comes out of two of my \u2018home states.' Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. (I have a third, actually: Tamil Nadu \u2014 which is where Jagathrakshakan comes from, so the scope for native pride is pretty large.) But let's turn to Andhra Pradesh. Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy is not in power. This has not hampered his entrepreneurial march. In 24 months till April this year, he added well over Rs.357 crore to his just-under Rs.72 crore-figure of April 2009. <i>This means he added on average over Rs.50 lakh every single day during this period. </i>Considering he's been embattled on all fronts, this is no minor achievement. Now you know what the pundits mean when they speak of the dynamism of Generation Next in politics.</p> <p class=\"body\">Only Chandrababu Naidu, alas, has grown poorer. The former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister made public his asset worth in view of \u2018the climate' ushered in by the Anna Hazare era. Mr. Naidu isn't even worth Rs.40 lakh. There is no immediate cause for concern over his livelihood though. His wife is worth almost Rs.40 crore. Yet, the relative picture is a microcosm of Andhra politics: Jagan on the rise, Naidu in decline. But while The Fates have not been kind to Mr. Naidu, his accountants have been more generous. His Jubilee Hill property (1,125 square yards, or over 10,000 square feet) shows up as worth no more than Rs.23.20 lakh. Now this is the costliest locality in Andhra Pradesh. So building a 10,000 square-foot home there, on that amount, argues great frugality. But wasn't it worth nearly Rs.9 crore in his 2009 poll affidavit? This time around Mr. Naidu gives us only the \u2018cost of acquisition' and not the market value, since the latter \u2018varies from time to time.'</p> <p class=\"body\">There are, though, serious lessons to be learnt from all of this beyond the need for smart accountants. This insane rise in affluence and wealth is not just about ministers but about MPs and MLAs too. And leaders at all levels of the main political forces, particularly the Congress, the BJP and most ruling or big parties in the states. The number of crore<i>patis</i> is up in Parliament and every State assembly. In Maharashtra, they went up from 108 in 2004 to 186 in 2009. Over three-fourths of the Union Cabinet are crore<i>patis</i>. Much of their new wealth was acquired while in office.</p> <p class=\"body\">Thanks to public anger and the persistence of the ADRs and NEWs, data on this comes more into the open. That is excellent. But all declarations must include what they paid as taxes. That would allow the public to make slightly better sense of the numbers. If you want transparency in public service, surely that should include having all their returns online, too. This would be a major reform, one amongst the many we badly need. Another is penalties for cheating. ADR shows us ministers whose declarations do not include 12 residential buildings they own.</p> <p class=\"body\">We need to have a serious audit, starting with the wealth of the Union Cabinet. How do people make half a million rupees a day while in office? Remember most of them made the greatest additions to their wealth while \u2018serving' the public. Surely we are owed answers on this. Mere disclosure of wealth is not enough. If it is so grotesquely large, we need to know how it was made.</p> <p class=\"body\">In late April, the Planning Commission filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court defending a per capita expenditure of Rs.20 a day as a viable cut-off line for determining poverty in urban India. For rural India that was just Rs.15. They say they might give the Rs.20 figure a generous upgrade \u2014 all the way to Rs.25. Remember the report of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector headed the late Dr. Arjun Sengupta? It recorded that 836 million Indians live on Rs.20 a day or less. How do our clubs of crore<i>patis</i> represent these masses? Or do some start by doing so and lose anchor very quickly? How do we curb this? It's something to think about. So are the profound changes of the last 20 years that have made it so difficult for any but millionaires to contest elections, let alone win them.</p>", "date": "September 21, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-union-cabinet-gets-healthier/article2470835.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["asset declaration", "unorganised sector", "India poverty", "Cabinet Ministers' assets"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["\u2018Kudumbashree' dominates Kerala local polls"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nThey are tailors, farmers, accountants, legal clerks, homemakers, vendors and activists. There are M.Com degree holders alongside poor women from deprived backgrounds. Together, they make up the most highly educated women candidates fighting local body elections anywhere in the country. There are nearly 40,000 of them contesting the polls across more than 1,200 local bodies in Kerala including 978 panchayats. And there will be at least 10,000 women in office on October 27 thanks to a 50 per cent reservation of seats for them in the state's local bodies.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Active participation</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nUnlike in some states, hundreds of seats won't be left uncontested. No scores of \u2018unopposed' candidates. Each ward will see vigorous fights. Many of the women in the fray are officially classified as poor and are very active in \u2018Kudumbashree' \u2014 the state government's extraordinary anti-poverty programme. \u2018Kudumbashree', which the women here refer to as CDS (community development society) is where much of the energy and the drive in these polls is coming from. Over 11,000 candidates have a CDS background. There are even women candidates in some general seats. Days from now, women could account for 52 per cent of all local body representatives.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAdat in Thrissur is a United Democratic Front (UDF)-led local body that was selected as the \u2018best panchayat' by the LDF government. Stella Jojo, the articulate UDF (Congress) candidate and a first-time contestant here, was once selected the \u201cBest Chairperson of Kudumbashree in Thrissur district.\u201d She says the 50 per cent reservation is \u201ca great step forward. And women are demanding their share.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn another ward, Priya Prasannan is an M.Com graduate and LDF (CPI-M) candidate. Her husband has taken time off from his job in Qatar to help organise her poll campaign. \u201cFamily support,\u201d she says, \u201cis an important thing if someone like me, with three children, is to contest an election.\u201d She is clear that \u201cdaily wages are the main issue here. And further, women can handle questions of controlling alcohol better.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Nenmanikara panchayat, V.T. Vijayalakshmi, a tailor and panchayat secretary of the All-India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA), is in the fray. For her \u201cEquality is the main issue. Some men may fear a loss of power. And within ourselves, our diffidence is partly psychological. But we have the confidence now.\u201d Her colleague Sindhu Subramaniam, a ground-level banker \u2014 she is president of the Vanitha Cooperative Thrift Society \u2014 is fighting from another ward. Sindhu, like Vijayalakshmi, finished her SSLC. She then qualified as a \u2018Hindi Vidhwan.' She feels the reservation-based polls \u201care a matter of pride for Kerala. In the past, women have been confined to just home and children. Now, the public sphere is so very much bigger.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>What it is</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAll of them are agreed on a few things: That men do not consult women on any vital matters. That women will do better in local government \u201csince they identify with the family more easily \u2014 and in the village panchayat level, you are dealing with families.\u201d That women are, as Vijayalakshmi puts it, \u201con the whole less corrupt and more accessible.\u201d And that \u2018Kudumbashree' has been a turning point for the women of Kerala. Stella Jojo says it is \u201cthe entry point to public life.\u201d Sindhu Subramaniam feels CDS \u201cgave women confidence and solidarity. It brought them together to discuss serious subjects. Vitally, it gave them their first exposure to the banking sector.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Kudumbashree (The Kerala State Poverty Eradication Mission) which, organisationally, federates the different neighbourhood groups has a larger than life presence in these polls. Over 3.7 million women in Kerala are part of this network of women's groups in Kerala . (Kerala does not refer to them as \u2018self-help' groups. For one thing that philosophy is seen as narrow and isolating. For another, the programme blends state support and dynamic community action. And pushes a vision of a collective and societal drive towards betterment).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nProf. Ananya Mukherjee of York University, Toronto, points to the innovative approach to food security of these groups. \u201cSome 2,50,000 Kudumbashree women throughout Kerala have come together to form farming collectives which jointly lease land, cultivate it, use the produce to meet their consumption needs and sell the surplus to local markets. \u201cThis,\u201d she points out, \u201cincreases the participation of women in agriculture ... (and) ensures that women, as producers, have control over the production, distribution and consumption of food.\u201d They have reached deep within communities. Both Stella Jojo and Vijayalakshmi assert: \u201cWe do not fear the campaigning. People approach us in CDS more easily than they do their local representative. We are more credible because of \u2018Kudumbashree'.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, if you are a CDS chairperson in a panchayat, then you must resign that post to contest an election. \u201cChairperson gets an honorarium of Rs. 2,000 from government,\u201d points out Stella Jojo. So she resigned to contest. As have 246 other CDS chairpersons across Kerala. The poll bug has bitten deep.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>The State's record</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nKerala's record of representation for women in several spheres is not a happy one. There are just seven women in the Kerala legislature out of 140 members. There are presently no women Lok Sabha MPs from the state. There are very few women, perhaps just one or two, at the top levels of leadership of any of the political parties. There have been two women appointed as vice chancellors of universities this past decade after having none for years. All indicators of a strong negative bias.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo what stops the elected women from again being handed trivial chores within the panchayats? In one estimate, women earlier chaired just two per cent of the Finance Standing Committees in Kerala's 978 panchayats. \u201cThis time,\u201d says N. Ramakantan, Director of the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA), \u201cif the president of the Panchayat is a male, then the vice-president is a woman and vice versa. The vice-president is the ex-officio chairperson of the Finance Standing Committee. So a woman will be either panchayat president or vice-president and thus chairperson of that standing committee.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere is male disquiet across the political spectrum over the coming changes. Adat Panchayat President Anil Akkara declares himself for the 50 per cent reservation for women. However, he worries over the effects of \u201cthe rotation. A seat should stay in one category for three terms. Otherwise there is no continuity.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Guruvayoor municipality, the amiable K.A. Sreedharan, candidate of the UDF (Congress) says he is \u201cnot insecure at all. But 50 per cent reservation might give us several representatives who cannot function well.\u201d He giggles sheepishly when asked how well he thinks the state legislature, where male dominance is 95 per cent, functions. The change has just barely begun.\n</p>", "date": "October 21, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/kudumbashree-dominates-kerala-local-polls/article841001.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Kerala local polls", "UDF", "local elections", "P.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Games big corporations play"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Over 20,000 killed. Over half a million victims maimed, disabled or otherwise affected. Compensation of around Rs.12,414 per victim on average on the 1989 value of the rupee. ($470 million or Rs.713 crore. And that divided among 574,367 victims.) Over a quarter-of-a-century's wait. To see seven former officials of Union Carbide Corporation's Indian subsidiary sentenced to two years in prison and fined Rs.1 lakh each. Not a single person from the far more responsible parent U.S. company punished.</p> <p class=\"body\">Yet, the notion that the main injustice to Bhopal is the failure to extradite then UCC chief Warren Anderson from America is mildly ridiculous. Trying to evade the lessons the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster threw up on the tyranny of giant corporations is completely so. Well over two decades after its MIC gas slaughtered 20,000 (mostly very poor) human beings, Bhopal still pays the price of Carbide's criminality. (Evident from the long-term impact on the health of the gas-affected. And from the poisoned soil and water around the former Carbide plant.) While the Indian government's appalling Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, if adopted, would give legal cover to such conduct across the country.</p> <p class=\"body\">Bhopal marked the horrific beginning of a new era. One that signalled the collapse of restraint on corporate power. The ongoing BP spill in the Mexican Gulf \u2014 with estimates ranging from 30,000-80,000 barrels a day \u2014 tops off a quarter-of-a-century where corporations could (and have) done anything in the pursuit of profit, at any human cost. Barack Obama's \u2018hard words' on BP are mostly pre-November poll-rants. The BP can take a lot of comfort from two U.S. Supreme Court judgments in the past two years.</p> <p class=\"body\">The first of these came in 2008. That was in the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 \u2014 till then the biggest recorded (or admitted to) oil spill in history. Simply put, BP's blowout is recreating an Exxon Valdez every eight days or so. And has been doing that since late April. In the Exxon case, a jury in 1994 imposed penalties of $5 billion on the company. In 2006, points out Sharon Smith in an incisive piece in counterpunch.org, \u201can appeals court halved the punitive claim to $2.5 billion.\u201d And in June 2008, \u201cthe Supreme Court reduced that amount by 80 per cent, to roughly $500 million \u2014 an average of $15,000 per plaintiff.\u201d Exxon CEO Lee Raymond who fiercely fought the damages, retired with a $400 million package all for himself. While Exxon Valdez's victims, points out Smith, ended up with roughly the same amount \u2014 only, it was shared among 33,000 of them. That is about 10 per cent of the original award and roughly $15,000 per victim.</p> <p class=\"body\">In September the same year, Wall Street's kleptocrats famously tanked the world economy. Their actions cost millions in America and elsewhere their jobs and livelihoods. Yet, U.S. CEOs took home billions in bonuses that very year. Even <i>The New York Times</i> felt the need to say in a lead editorial at the time: \u201cJust weeks after the Treasury Department gave nine of the nation's top banks $125 billion in taxpayer dollars to save them from unprecedented calamity, bank executives are salting money away in billionaire bonus pools to reward themselves for their performance.\u201d (In that election year, Big Oil also drummed up support for offshore drilling with this cheery slogan: \u2018Drill, Baby, Drill.' What'll it be now? \u2018Spill, Baby, Spill?')</p> <p class=\"body\">This year, barely three months before BP turned the Gulf of Mexico into a sludge pond, the U.S. Supreme Court further strengthened corporate power with its ruling in the <i>Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission</i> case. As Ralph Nader put it: \u201cWith this decision, corporations can now directly pour vast amounts of corporate money ... into the electoral swamp already flooded with ... [corporate] dollars ... corporations can [now] reward or intimidate people running for office at the local, state, and national levels.\u201d Mason Gaffney makes the point in the Counterpunch Newsletter that \u201cThe ideas behind this are that a corporation is a \u2018legal person,' with all the rights [if not all the duties] of a human being; that, as such, it has a right of free speech; and that donating money is a form of speech.\u201d So chin up, BP, there's still hope. Remember how many who make it to Congress and Senate get there on Big Oil's big bucks. </p> <p class=\"body\">While on the BP spill, spare a thought for the victims of such disasters who are not American or white-skinned. As <i>Foreign Policy in Focus</i> columnist Conn Hallinan points out: \u201cNigerian government figures show there have been more than 9000 spills between 1970 and 2000, and there are currently 2,000 official spill sites.\u201d But then, what are African lives worth?</p> <p class=\"body\">Seven years after Bhopal, Larry Summers, then chief economist at the World Bank, wrote his infamous memo. This said, among other things: \u201cJust between you and me, shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging MORE migration of the dirty industries to the LDCs [Less Developed Countries]?\u201d Summers suggested that \u201cthe economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">Summers was to later say that he was joking, being sarcastic, and so on. Few buy that pathetic plea. Still, he went on to become President of Harvard and is now President Obama's chief economic adviser. And his memo's logic holds in the real world. It is exactly what has happened since Bhopal. </p> <p class=\"body\">The UPA's response to the Bhopal sentences shows the government's ethics to be as despicable as they were in 1984. To mourn Bhopal and ready the nuclear liability bill is a hypocrisy hard to match. Bhopal was a post-facto sell-out. With the nuclear liability bill, the government sells out in advance. Is it only governments that have something to hide from Bhopal 1984? Even at the time, newspapers gladly carried planted stories suggesting \u201csabotage by Carbide's workers\u201d had caused the disaster. Four years later, a UCC-funded \u2018study' claimed to prove that the disaster was caused by a disgruntled worker at the plant. Carbide also ensured it could not be sued in U.S. courts. In December 1985, some of India's great legal luminaries, including Nani Palkhivala, helped persuade U.S. courts that Indian courts were the appropriate forum to deal with the case. (With results that we now live with.) That spared Carbide the relatively much higher damages the U.S. courts might have imposed.</p> <p class=\"body\">Barely 10 years later, Enron emerged as the symbol of the new era of liberalisation. Top academics, \u2018experts,' and columnists worked hard to tell us what nice guys the Enron mob were. All this, after much initial criticism of the Enron deal. The change of heart was possibly a transplant funded by tens of millions of dollars set up by that company to \u201ceducate\u201d Indian opinion-makers, lawmakers, etc. Advertising, too, flowed freely. One famous newspaper started out very critical of Enron, only to switch to being one of its cheerleaders. Many others, too, did the same. I guess that kind of fund buys a lot of education. For Maharashtra and India, it bought disaster. The once profit-making State electricity board piled up millions in losses. The State, in turn, slashed money from welfare projects and services. Enron, fraud that it was, collapsed in the U.S., some of its top guns turning fugitives from the law. The mess remains with us. The one chance of evading disaster vanished when the Supreme Court threw out a petition against the Enron deal brought by the CITU and Abhay Mehta, and that was that.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, Mr. Obama's rhetoric seems to have hurt British sentiments. The truth is that the U.S. has helped, even subsidised, BP in the past. In what Alexander Cockburn calls \u201cthe biggest bailout in history,\u201d the CIA staged a now infamous coup in Iran in 1953 to get rid of Mohammed Mossadegh's government. The Iranian Parliament had by unanimous vote nationalised the exploitative Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Mossadegh was toppled. Installed in his place was \u201cShah Reza Pahlevi, the creature of the West's oil companies, with full tyrannical powers. The AIOC got back 40 per cent of its old concession and became an internationally owned consortium, renamed \u2014 British Petroleum.\u201d The lists of corporate-sponsored coups in the third world would fill volumes.</p> <p class=\"body\">All that the Union Carbide did and got away with in Bhopal is shocking. But not, alas, surprising. In the quarter-of-a-century since then, corporate power has only grown.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Illegal financial flows: the great drain robbery"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">India is losing nearly Rs.240 crore every 24 hours, on average, in illegal financial flows out of the country. The nation lost $213 billion (roughly Rs.9.7 lakh crore) in illegal capital flight between 1948 and 2008. However, over $125 billion (Rs.5.7 lakh crore) of that was lost in just this decade between 2000-2008, according to a study by Global Financial Integrity (GFI). These \u201cillicit financial flows,\u201d says GFI, \u201cwere generally the product of corruption, bribery and kickbacks, criminal activities and efforts to shelter wealth from a country's tax authorities.\u201d GFI is a programme of the Center for International Policy, Washington D.C. It is a non-profit research and advocacy body that \u201cpromotes national and multilateral policies, safeguards, and agreements aimed at curtailing the cross-border flow of illegal money.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In just five years from 2004-08 alone, the country lost roughly Rs.4.3 lakh crore to such outflows. That is \u2014 <i>nearly two and a half times the value of the 2G telecom scam now exercising Parliament and the media.</i> The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) pegs the 2G scam at almost Rs.1.8 lakh crore.</p> <p class=\"body\">Accounting for the rate of return on those illegal outflows, the present value of that $ 213 billion reaches $ 462 billion (Rs.21 lakh crore) says GFI. Astonishingly, over $96 billion of that amount left the country between 2004 and 2008. As the report's author, Dev Kar, told <i>The</i><i>Hindu</i>: \u201cIndia is losing capital at an average rate of $19.3 billion per annum ... India can ill afford to ignore such a loss of capital.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">As the report puts it: \u201cHad India managed to avoid this staggering loss of capital, the country could have paid off its outstanding external debt of $230.6 billion (as of end-2008) and have another half left over for poverty alleviation and economic development.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">At the 2004-08 pace (if it has not gone up), the economy is haemorrhaging at a rate of nearly Rs.240 crore every day on average. And even the total $462 billion, says GFI Director Raymond W. Baker in a letter prefacing the report, is \u201ca conservative estimate. It does not include smuggling, certain forms of trade mispricing and gaps in available statistics.\u201d Factor these in, and \u201cit is entirely reasonable to estimate that more than a half-trillion dollars have drained from India since independence.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The GFI study is titled \u201cThe Drivers and Dynamics of Illicit Financial Flows from India: 1948-2008.\u201d Authored by Dr. Kar, formerly a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and now Lead Economist at the GFI, it defines \u2018illicit flows' as \u201ccomprised of funds that are illegally earned, transferred, or utilised \u2014 if laws were broken in the origin, movement, or use of the funds then they are illicit.\u201d Such fund transfers are not recorded in the country of origin for they typically violate that nation's laws and banking regulations.</p> <p class=\"body\">So massive are these illegal outflows, says the study, that the \u201ctotal capital flight represents approximately 16.6 per cent of India's GDP as of year-end 2008.\u201d Its estimate falls far short of the $1.4 trillion figure cited in the India media prior to the 2009 general elections. But, says the report, \u201cthe figure still represents a staggering loss of capital.\u201d Illegal flight of capital, it says, \u201cworsens income distribution, reduces the effectiveness of external aid, and hampers economic development.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">That does seem an obvious outcome in a country where according to the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS), 836 million human beings live spending Rs.20 a day or less.</p> <p class=\"body\">The illegal outflows also account for most of India's parallel economy. \u201cThe total value of (such) illicit assets held abroad represents about 72 per cent of the size of India's underground economy which has been estimated at 50 per cent of India's GDP (or about $640 billion at end-2008) by several researchers. This implies that only about 28 per cent of illicit assets of India's underground economy are held domestically.\u201d It also strengthens arguments that \u201cthe desire to amass wealth without attracting government attention is one of the primary motivations behind the cross-border transfer of illicit capital.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The GFI study makes two vital points amongst others that will surely stoke ongoing debates in the country. One: the drain bloated massively in the era of economic liberalisation and reforms starting with 1991. Two: \u201cHigh net-worth individuals and private companies were found to be the primary drivers of illicit flows out of India's private sector.\u201d Conversely, \u201cIndia's underground economy is also a significant driver of illicit financial flows.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">As Mr. Baker says: \u201cWhat is clear is that, during the post-reform period of 1991-2008, deregulation and trade liberalisation have accelerated the outflow of illicit money from the Indian economy. The opportunities for trade mispricing have grown, and expansion of the global shadow financial system accommodates hot money, particularly in island tax havens. Disguised corporations situated in secrecy jurisdictions enable billions of dollars shifting out of India to \u201cround trip,\u201d coming back into short and long-term investments, often with the intention of generating unrecorded transfers again in a self-reinforcing cycle.\u201d Interestingly, the points about high net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and corporates and \u2018mispricing' take the debate way beyond the clich\u00e9d \u2018corrupt politician' explanation.</p> <p class=\"body\">The report, while stressing these factors, says that given the limitations of available data, it found \u201cscant evidence that imprudent macroeconomic policies drove illicit flows from the country.\u201d It lauds the post 1991-reform era. And praises Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for launching \u201cIndia's free market reforms that saved the country,\u201d in its view, \u201cfrom financial ruin and placed it on a path to sustained economic growth.\u201d On the role of macroeconomic policies in the outflows, it says there is yet work to be done, data to be generated. </p> <p class=\"body\">But its own evidence on how the outflows escalated post-1991 is pretty damning. And India's liberalisation itself \u2014 in which period the GFI study records the greatest drain \u2014 was about a sea change in macroeconomic policies. The study notes a rise in inequality in the reform period. And acknowledges, in its summary, that \u201cA more skewed distribution of income implies that there are many more HNWIs in India now than ever before.\u201d It implies that governance issues, deregulation without new oversight and a complex web of other factors were more to blame.</p> <p class=\"body\">GFI calls for measures that would require country-by-country reporting of sales, profits and taxes paid by multinational corporations. It recommends India should curb \u2018trade mispricing.' Because \u201ctransfers of illicit capital through trade mispricing account for 77.6 per cent of total outflows from India over the period 1948-2008.\u201d It advises steps that would require automatic cross-border exchange of tax information on personal and business accounts. And actions that would harmonise vital matters under anti-money laundering laws across nations.</p>", "date": "November 17, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/illegal-financial-flows-the-great-drain-robbery/article892140.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Illegal money", "Global Financial Integrity", "bribery", "kickbacks"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Oliver Twist seeks food security"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The rotting of lakhs of tonnes of foodgrain in open yards, while shocking, is hardly new or surprising. Remember the rural poor marching on godowns in Andhra Pradesh in 2001 in similar circumstances? The Supreme Court was quite right in jolting the Union government. \u201cIn a country where admittedly people are starving, it is a crime to waste even a single grain,\u201d said the annoyed Court. And suggested that the grain be released to those who deserve it.</p> <p class=\"body\">Strong and welcome words. However, the Court could take matters much further if it sees why the Government of India would rather have that grain rot than let the hungry eat it. The failure to understand that leads us to pit poor against poor. To see people in the APL category as the enemies of those who are BPL. Hence the suggestion that we take away grain from one to give it to the other. APL was itself a fiction created by the government to \u201creduce\u201d the number of poor it was obliged to help. So the GoI would act selectively on this part of the Court's advice with glee. This would exclude those in APL from even the pathetic little aid they get.</p> <p class=\"body\">It will ignore the more important order of the Court to distribute the grain before it rots. It might pull up Food Corporation of India officers unable to look after the grain but who did not cause it to pile up in the first place. When you have twice the grain you are equipped to stock, you have a problem. The GoI could distribute that grain. Or release it at low prices through the public distribution system. It would hate either option. That would run against the grain of its ideology and economics. Letting the hungry eat it would, for the government, increase the \u201csubsidy burden.\u201d Why would the government do that after successfully slashing Rs. 450 crore from food subsidy in the current budget?</p> <p class=\"body\">Two arguments mark the opposition to a universal system (whether in the PDS or other sectors like health). One, there is no money. Two, we do not have enough grain for a universal system.</p> <p class=\"body\">The nation has spawned 49 dollar billionaires and about a 100,000 dollar millionaires in a decade. But it has no money to feed its hungry. So says a government that tosses Rs.500,000 crore of tax exemptions to the wealthy in the current budget under just three heads.</p> <p class=\"body\">Not producing enough grain? Well, we spent two decades shifting countless lakhs of farmers from growing food to raising cash crops. That shift involved greater input costs, higher debt and more. We sowed risk and harvested hunger. </p> <p class=\"body\">The impact on foodgrain? The average daily net per capita availability of foodgrain between 2005 and 2008 is a dismal 436 grams per Indian. That's less than it was half a century ago. In 1955-58, it was 440 grams. Take pulses separately and the fall is 50 per cent. Around 35 grams in 2005-08 from nearly 70 grams in 1955-58.</p> <p class=\"body\">This hasn't stopped governments from claiming \u201crecord production\u201d every other year. Remember the \u201crecord surpluses\u201d in 2001-03? Those years we exported millions of tonnes of grain at prices lower than those offered to our own deprived. That grain fed European cattle \u2014 the most food-secure creatures on earth. While hundreds of millions went hungry at home. Today's rotting grain, too, will at some point be flogged off to private traders at throwaway rates.</p> <p class=\"body\">These last two decades also saw the collapse of public investment in agriculture. To starve farming of funds and say we haven't enough grain is a travesty. Actually, commit yourself to universalisation, revive food crop, give the farmer a good price and boost the dismal levels of procurement that now exist. You'd be surprised how fast you can meet that challenge of production.</p> <p class=\"body\">Instead, we seem to be heading, courtesy the National Advisory Council (NAC), for a \u201cuniversal\u201d system in 150 districts. \u201cUniversal\u201d here could mean rice or wheat at Rs. 3 a kg to a limit of 35 kg per household. This \u201cuniversal\u201d stops at rice and wheat, will not include pulses, oils and millets, does not see the size of a household and is limited to a fourth of the country. You can't, goes the saying, be a little bit pregnant. You can't be a little bit universal either. The debate between \u201ctargeting\u201d \u2014 which is what the 150-districts notion is \u2014 and a universal PDS is not one over different routes to the same goal. It is one over different goals. You are either universal, or you are not. This move invites chaos.</p> <p class=\"body\">First, as an editorial (August 10) in this newspaper pointed out, this seems to equate hunger with geography. What of millions in other districts? Are they not hungry? And how, for instance, would this impact on millions of poor migrant labourers? </p> <p class=\"body\">Take Orissa's Ganjam district which sends out four lakh migrant workers to Surat alone in Gujarat. Now Ganjam could well be in the 150 districts. How will its hungry migrants access that grain in Surat? Surely, Surat will not be in the list of 150? Can't you just see the store keeper in Surat telling the migrant: \u201cYes, son, I've seen the law, too. Here's your rice at Rs. 3.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, even as these migrants fail to access their Rs. 3 a kilo grain, Ganjam could well be dropped from the list of 150 at some point \u2014 citing \u201cpoor demand.\u201d Thane in Maharashtra with its famished adivasis, could well be a Rs.3-a-kilo district. Next door is Mumbai where rice goes at Rs.30 to Rs.40 a kilo. Result? Most of Thane's cheap rice will migrate to Mumbai.</p> <p class=\"body\">Or take agricultural labourers in Orissa. An adult needs at least 750 grams of rice a day. So a family of five (including children) needs around 3 kg of rice a day. Let's say they cannot manage more than 2.75 kg a day. They would still consume 82.5 kilos a month. The new \u201cuniversal\u201d would give them 35 kg of that for Rs.105. The remaining 47.5 kg, at Rs. 22 a kilo or more, would cost them well over Rs.1000. Where will they get that from?</p> <p class=\"body\">Why do lakhs migrate each year from Kalahandi or Bolangir seeking work outside when the NREGS exists in those districts? Why do so many prefer the lesser pay of brick kilns in Andhra Pradesh? One major reason is that the NREGS restricts them to 100 days per household. In the awful brick kilns of Andhra Pradesh, every member of a five-strong family (including children) can get work for up to 180-200 days. The NREGS is restricted. The PDS is targeted. Only exploitation is universal.</p> <p class=\"body\">Yet the debate has been over things like whether each family should have 25 or 35 kg. This is an Oliver Twist approach to food security. \u201cPlease, sir, I want some more.\u201d Coming from within the NAC, that wrongly casts Montek Ahluwalia of the Planning Commission in the role of Bumble, or Pranab Mukherjee as Fagin. In truth, the two make Bumble and Fagin seem reckless philanthropists. But there's a bigger problem to what's going on. It happens with each sector. The sequence is the same.</p> <p class=\"body\">The good guys create a demand for legislation. The government agrees. Next, the well-intentioned come up with a draft the government then dilutes. After which the Planning Commission declares the effort to still be unworkable. So it's thinned down again. Then the Finance Ministry says: \u201cwhere's the money?\u201d And it's watered down to an irrelevance. What remains is something that enshrines the right of the Indian people to cross the street (when the green signal that says \u2018walk' is on).</p> <p class=\"body\">Obviously it fails badly in practice. Targeting always does. That's when Bumble, Fagin, The Artful Dodger and the rest of the Dickensian crew come up with what will be their solution to every such problem: smart cards, unique identification numbers, food stamps, vouchers and cash transfers. (And GM foods to meet production targets.) That's where it's headed \u2014 towards a worse disaster.</p> <p class=\"body\">The food security legislation in the form that now seems likely weakens and dilutes the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Indian Constitution. Those are universal, not targeted. Sure, we have to move towards making them real. But we need at every stage to ask whether the steps we take strengthen or weaken the Directive Principles. These steps on food security weaken them. Also when we act in isolation in one sector like food, we undermine the vital others. What we could do with is a comprehensive universal programme that covers nutrition, work, health and education. At one time, for one nation.</p>", "date": "August 11, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/oliver-twist-seeks-food-security/article564918.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["public distribution system", "food security bill", "NREGS", "P.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Obama: after the gush and the drool"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Now that the media's gush and drool over the Obama visit has run dry \u2014 thanks to other far more interesting events \u2014 it might be worth looking at a couple of \u2018outcomes' that much of our media seemed pretty taken with.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u2018Twenty deals worth 10 billion dollars that create over 50,000 jobs.' That was the headline repeated with breathless excitement, especially on the first day of President Barack Obama's visit to India. These were jobs to be created in the U.S., with Indian money. But we were generously excited nonetheless. Here was a chief executive to be admired. Going out and getting the job \u2014 and jobs \u2014 done. A little perspective might help. Fifty thousand jobs are about what the United States has lost every week, on average, since December 2007. That is, for a straight 140 weeks.</p> <p class=\"body\">This figure too, is a conservative official estimate based on numbers put out over three years by the official United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). On that same basis, the Associated Press reports the U.S. as having lost 7.5 million jobs in 35 months since December 2007. That is, over 7,000 jobs each day on average. Anaemic upward blips in private sector employment in a few months has changed nothing. And in reality, the bulk of those jobs have been lost since September 2008. At a rate far worse than 7,000 a day.</p> <p class=\"body\">Even that is challenged by some economists who say the country's actual unemployment rate is way above the officially stated 9.6 per cent. The AP report does mention that \u201cThere were 14.8 million people unemployed in (this) October. Adding those people to others who are working part-time but would prefer full-time jobs and those who have given up looking for work, nearly 27 million are \u2018underemployed.' That's 17 per cent of the labour force.\u201d Even of the 14.8 million \u2018officially' unemployed, the BLS tells us that about 46 per cent of those were jobless for 27 weeks or longer and 31 per cent were unemployed for 52 weeks or more. The U.S. needs to be creating over 3,00,000 jobs each month to get out of the mess. Nope, 50,000 jobs, if they actually materialise, won't change much. But they do make a half-decent headline after a poll debacle. A good question, though, was why this was thought to be so important here, for us.</p> <p class=\"body\">Leave aside how many Indian jobs the $10 billion of Indian money creates. It is not clear how many of those 50,000 jobs will come up in the United States proper. Or if there will really be 50,000 at all. Quite a bit of that manufacture you're paying for could happen in countries other than the United States or India. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement \u2014 24 hours after the mid-term elections on November 2 in the United States \u2014 that it would buy up over $600 billion of U.S. debt, came as a gift for corporate America. And still without any obligation on them to create any jobs. Nor do we know how much of our $10 billion, a trifling sum in comparison, will go towards jobs and how much of it towards corporate profit in both the United States and India. The year the U.S. saw its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, American CEOs took home bonuses worth $18 billion. Since the meltdown, more than a trillion dollars have been poured down the gullets of a corporate world that created few, if any, jobs. So what employment will they create with $10 billion? But it did give a beleaguered Mr. Obama a headline for home. Fifty thousand jobs, wow! a whole week's worth. All perfectly normal blather. What was curious was our media's excitement over it.</p> <p class=\"body\">Far more important, was the cohort of over 200 corporate CEOs visiting India alongside the U.S. President. President Obama is, in his view, in the critical phase of \u2018rebuilding' his bridges with corporate America. The cosiness of this group tour was only part of what's been going. And the approach itself was plainly in view for quite some time before his November 3 nightmare. Mainstream U.S. media argue that he has \u2018alienated' the corporate world and Wall Street and you cannot run America that way. In reality, Mr. Obama was voted to power amidst huge outrage over the September 2008 meltdown and the role of Wall Street and bankers in that collapse. (Mr. McCain had a five-point lead in the Reuters-Zogby poll at end-August.) He then allowed the guilty of Wall Street and the banks to not only get away unscathed, but also script the \u2018recovery.' This, even as millions of dollars of bailout money vanished in bonuses and executive meetings at exclusive resorts. As Alexander Cockburn says in www.counterpunch.org, the rapid pro-corporate moves and the threat to medicare and social security are crazy signals to his own core base, \u2018which is organised labour and Black America.'</p> <p class=\"body\">Yet, Mr. Obama's move to the Right is relentless. The departure of his top economic adviser Larry Summers has only stoked a search for even more pro-corporate replacements. <i>The Washington Post</i> reported on November 17 that \u201cThe White House is eager to recruit someone from the business community for the job to help repair the President's frayed relationship with corporate America.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The fleet of 200 plus CEOs in India was, then, also part of that ongoing \u2018repair' process. For that's what the visit was mostly about. A good \u2018he cares' headline at home. And a corporate-driven trip to drum up business through a Presidential tour funded by U.S. public tax dollars. Sure the CEOs paid for their own travel. But they would never have had the same access and impact on their own, without the American President to do the drumming. Material outcomes on that front will take time to unfold, though.</p> <p class=\"body\">The other item hogging the headlines and much broadcast time was Mr. Obama's 'backing' India for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. It pays to play on the Indian elite's craving for certification from the United States. In the speech to which this \u2018backing' was attributed, Mr. Obama made two single-line references to India in the Security Council. Of these, one mentioned permanent membership.</p> <p class=\"body\">His first line: \u201c... we welcome India as it prepares to take its seat on the United Nations Security Council.\u201d India does that anyway on January 15 as an elected non-permanent member. The second: \u201cThat is why I can say today, in the years ahead, I look forward to a reformed U.N. Security Council that includes India as a permanent member.\u201d This, after first calling for a United Nations that America accepts as \u201cefficient, effective, credible and legitimate.\u201d And one which has been fully \u2018reformed.' That being aeons away, he could safely look forward to India as a permanent member \u2018in the years ahead.' (Some argue that vital U.N. reforms would include ending permanent membership or veto powers in the Security Council altogether. But that's another story.)</p> <p class=\"body\">To Mr. Obama's credit, he projected through the media at least, that jobs were a high priority. The Indian side, faced with an awful employment situation for far longer than the U.S., didn't once mention the question of jobs. The anchors gushing about the 50,000 jobs in the U.S. haven't a clue of the employment situation in their own country. Of how many millions have lost their work and livelihoods in the past decade. How fewer jobs are created each year in vital sectors. How the single state of Maharashtra lost two million jobs in 36 months <i>before the recession began</i>. How the recession here was utilised to get trillions of rupees worth of \u2018stimulus' packages for a corporate world laying off tens of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama's two dance interludes had a rock and awe effect. One commentator called her part \u201cthe real success story of the trip.\u201d (And perhaps it was, given the rest of it).</p> <p class=\"body\">The minutiae of discussions over the nuclear deal and the photo-ops at the luxury Taj Hotel (hardly the best symbol of 26/11) aside, the visit was about job headlines at home and a corporate market search. Which was quite logical from Mr. Obama's view and interests. Was it logical for us in covering the visit? For our media (with some honourable exceptions in both print and television) to play the trip the way it did? To gush over rather than report it? To fail to focus on what was in it for us? Or is it that the dominant media totally identify with the manner and thrust of the Indian elite's quest to be seated at the high table in the global hierarchy of nations?</p>", "date": "November 22, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/obama-after-the-gush-and-the-drool/article903883.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["employment", "U.S. economy"]}

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The discreet charm of civil society"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The 1990s saw marketing whiz kids at the largest English daily in the world steal a term then in vogue among sexually discriminated minorities: PLUs \u2014 or People Like Us. Media content would henceforth be for People Like Us. This served advertisers' needs and also helped shut out unwanted content. As the daily advised its reporters: dying farmers don't buy newspapers. South Mumbaikars do. So the suicide deaths of a couple of fashion models in that city grabbed more space in days than those of over 40,000 farmers in Maharashtra did in a decade.</p> <p class=\"body\">February 2011 saw one of the largest rallies staged in Delhi in years. Lakhs of workers from nine central trade unions \u2014 including the Congress party's INTUC \u2014 hit the streets to protest against rising food prices and unemployment. This was many times bigger than the very modest numbers at Anna Hazare's fast and larger than Ramdev's rollicking \u2018yoga camp.' These were workers and unions not linked to the state. Not market-driven. Not corporate-funded. And expressing clearly the interests and values of their members. In fact, fitting some classic definitions of \u2018civil society.' The rally was covered by the BBC, Reuters and AFP but was mostly invisible in mainstream Indian media except when attacked for creating traffic jams.</p> <p class=\"body\">Perhaps the whizz kids were on to something larger than even they knew. At least one dictionary has since added this entry under People Like Us: \u201cA subtle reference to people of the same socio-economic class.\u201d Only, there was nothing subtle here. The Indian elite play the PLU game like few others do. Entry into the club is by birth or invitation only. And getting certification from the classes that matter takes some work. Your own background can be surmounted however, even turned to advantage, if there are enough strong PLUs around you. Anna Hazare had this. Baba Ramdev did not have it. Both claimed to speak for \u2018civil society.' A media applying that word with reverence to those around Anna Hazare, denied it with scorn to those they saw as Ramdev's rabble.</p> <p class=\"body\">Sections of the media embarrassed by Ramdev point, in contrast, to the \u2018many fine people' around Hazare. Most of them part of the Delhi elite with indeed impeccable records of service. Yet, how did their approach differ in principle from Ramdev's?</p> <p class=\"body\">Both were self-selected groups claiming primacy over the elected government. Both asserted they knew what was best for the nation. (Rather than an electorate they scorned as sold on a bottle of liquor or a hundred-rupee note). Both had no qualms about breaking down the walls between the institutions of state. Never mind the Constitution, they sought a body whose members they would largely appoint. A super organ above the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. Take the government notification on the drafting body for the Lokpal bill. It uses the words: \u201cThe five nominees of Anna Hazare [including himself] are as under\u2026\u201d When have such vital national appointments been made by and in the name of one individual, however noble?</p> <p class=\"body\">Both felt they had the best solutions for fighting corruption, which is fair enough. Both, however, demanded that their fatwas be written into law. That their will prevail in the writing of the bill. That the Constitution assigns this right to the legislature mattered little. Both saw themselves as more representative of the nation than its people. In months, they would succeed where \u201cin 62 years\u201d the nation had failed.</p> <p class=\"body\">Electoral democracy drew special contempt. In this, they were at one with the top tier of PLUs. \u201cWho takes all that stuff seriously?\u201d asked one celeb on a television panel discussion. Well, it seems people do. Voting in Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu crossed 75 per cent in May 2011. In West Bengal and Puducherry, it edged towards 85 per cent. Tamil Nadu in May 2011 saw its highest turnout in 44 years. And voters there showed how vital the issue of corruption was to them. Money power has surely corrupted the <i>electoral process</i> severely. But does the <i>electorate</i> deserve the scorn poured on it by \u2018civil society?' If the latter has struck a chord at all, it is because of the deep concerns of the former.</p> <p class=\"body\">So who do these versions of Indian \u2018civil society' represent? Do we take the World Bank's definition? Civil society would then be: \u201ca wide array of non-governmental and not-for-profit organisations that have a presence in public life.\u201d And which express \u201cthe interests and values of their members or others, based on ethical, cultural, political, scientific, religious or philanthropic considerations.\u201d The European Commission states flatly that there is \u201cno commonly accepted or legal definition\u201d of the term. It also \u201cdoes not make a distinction between civil society organisations or other forms of interest groups.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The U.S.-based Civil Society International raises the question of whether the media should be included in \u2018civil society.' More so when they are privately-owned and hyper-commercial in character. It points out that some notions could render both the League of Women Voters and the Ku Klux Klan part of civil society. In India, the RSS is a large voluntary organisation claiming to be cultural and non-political in character. Ergo, civil society?</p> <p class=\"body\">Theory aside, civil society in India seems defined by exclusion. It is crowded with human rights lawyers and activists, NGO leaders, academics and intellectuals, high-profile journalists, celebrities and think tank-hirelings. Mass media debates never see landless labourers, displaced people, nurses, trade union workers, bus conductors being asked to speak for \u2018civil society.' Though, indeed they should.</p> <p class=\"body\">Marketing minds would define civil society more clearly as a prime PLU platform. They'd be right, too. Who else do we see out there? The PLU syndrome goes way beyond the Lokpal bill. When Kaushik Basu, chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry, called for a certain class of bribes to be legalised, \u2018civil society' simply shut its eyes and brain. The National Campaign for Peoples' Right to Information \u2014 a flag bearer of civil society \u2014 maintained a studied, shameful silence. Professor Basu was not pushing this idea in his private blog. He put it up on a Government of India website. Yet, thundering anchors who \u2018skewer' politicians in television interviews uttered not a squeak. Had this insane idea come from a Ramdev, or even a Lalu Prasad, and not from a certified PLU member, imagine the fun the media would have had trashing it. As for the NCPRI, it might have begun a special desk to campaign on the issue. True, an individual associated with it did write a mild critique of the <i>economics</i> of Prof. Basu's folly \u2014 evading its moral degeneracy. But the NCPRI let itself down (and all those who support the RTI movement) with its craven silence.</p> <p class=\"body\">The same media now trashing Ramdev came out snarling in his defence when he clashed with Brinda Karat in 2006. That was over the exploitation of 113 workers thrown out of the pharmacy controlled by Ramdev's Trust and facing false cases. The media brushed that aside and slammed Ms Karat. In the PLU food chain, workers are a low form of pond life. (Oh yes, the PLU syndrome has a strong caste component, too. But that's another story.)</p> <p class=\"body\">Ramdev had carved out a base in sections of the elite. He also counts some media owners amongst his followers. Though not, perhaps the more anglicised anchors of television. He even has a following in Bollywood. He had attained the celebrity status so vital to gain any media attention at all. And had done so by using television itself for his \u2018brand' of yoga. But he overplayed his hand when the desired \u2018A-level' certification from the south Delhi elite was still pending. Otherwise, his claim to represent \u2018civil society' is no weaker than that of the group around Mr. Hazare. The \u2018my-civil-society-is-more-civil-than-yours' squabble has begun. And both groups have failed to pin down a corrupt, bungling government that made such a pig's breakfast of the Ramlila event.</p> <p class=\"body\">There is nothing wrong in having advisory groups. Not a thing wrong in governments consulting them and also listening to people, particularly those affected by its decisions. There is a problem when groups not constituted legally cross the line of demands, advice and rights-based, democratic agitation. When they seek to run the government and legislation \u2014 no matter how well-intentioned they are. Pushing a coherent vision is a good thing to do. So is demanding that the government do its job. Beyond that lies trouble.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, a section of Platinum tier PLUs have become champions of the parliamentary democracy they actively helped undermine during the past two decades. They cheered loudly for giant economic and financial decisions taken outside the budget, bypassing Parliament. So long as the destruction of institutions favoured corporate power, they welcomed it, collaborating with corrupt governments such as this one wholeheartedly. The Ramdev route would have done much the same in time \u2014 the Baba himself is a spiritual corporation. But he just wasn't one of us. These new champions of parliamentary democracy have no qualms when the groups dictating terms to the government are CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM or their ilk. They didn't like it when the bypassing of institutions came from Mr. Hazare. They hated it when it came from Ramdev. Dumping democracy is, after all, the privilege of the Platinum PLUs.</p>", "date": "June 17, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-discreet-charm-of-civil-society/article2110433.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["anti-corruption movement", "Anna Hazare campaign", "Lokpal Bill", "civil society"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Small bypolls, big signals"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nThe elections to five State assemblies earlier this year surely deserved the public and media attention they got. The country's most populous State, Uttar Pradesh, was one of those holding polls. And many saw the millions of voters in these States as giving us a preview to the general elections due in 2014. Yet, the results of the small number of by-elections in Andhra Pradesh last month might tell us more about which way the Congress (and its leadership of the United Progressive Alliance) is going. And the results of polls to local bodies in the vital State of Maharashtra also throw up some signals worth a glance. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>The big picture in A.P.</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Congress has far more to lose in Andhra Pradesh, where it is in power, than it does in U.P. It has 33 Lok Sabha MPs from here, more seats than it holds in any other State. In fact, no other party holds that many seats on its own from any other State either. So A.P. is crucial to the Congress nationally. In Andhra Pradesh, the Congress could, on its own, hit the 40 per cent vote-mark or higher. But that is something it will not do in 2014 when it might, in fact, face disaster. The Congress contested all seven Assembly seats where bypolls were held in A.P., including six in Telangana \u2014 and lost them all by huge margins. In Telangana, it lost the Kamareddy seat to the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) by nearly 45,000 votes. It trailed the TRS in Adilabad and Ghanpur (Station) by well over 30,000 votes in each. And came third in Mahbubnagar, trailing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winner by 14,000 votes. Oddly, that was actually the seat where it performed best, in terms of the margin of defeat. It lost Nagarkurnool to a TRS-backed ex-TDP leader by over 27,000 votes. And trailed the TRS by over 15,000 in Kollapur. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Congress, TDP hit</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWho held these seats earlier? The bypoll to the Mahbubnagar seat (now won by the BJP) was caused by the death of the Congress MLA there. In five others, resignations by sitting MLAs pushing the Telangana demand, forced the bypolls. Kollapur and Ghanpur (Station) had Congress MLAs who resigned to contest on the TRS platform. Both won. Adilabad and Kamareddy had TDP MLAs who quit their seats and won this time on TRS tickets. Nagarkurnool was held by a TDP leader who left the party and contested on his own platform, backed by the TRS. He won, too. And in the coastal Andhra seat of Kovur, the sitting TDP MLA had gone with Jagan and was disqualified. He's back on the ticket of the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRC) of Jaganmohan Reddy. So both the Congress and the TDP have taken a hit. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nTrue, the margins might have been less had the YSRC contested in Telangana as well. But then the Congress might have come third in two or three more constituencies. Jagan Reddy seems to have stayed out in order to let the TRS slaughter the Congress. But the result in Kovur in coastal Andhra, which the YSRC did contest, was in some ways more ominous. Its winning candidate here was N. Prasanna Kumar Reddy. The same gentleman had been the sitting MLA of Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) till he chose to join Jagan Reddy. As a TDP man in 2009 he won by around 7,400 votes. This time contesting against that party and the Congress, he won by more than 23,000 votes. That is by over three times his previous margin. The Congress which he had beaten the last time, came third this time. This suggests the YSR Congress is cutting into both the TDP and the Congress. It also means, if this is the trend, that the Congress is not just in trouble in Telangana. It might run into worse in coastal Andhra. In the Rayalaseema region, it lost the Kadapa seat last May to Jagan Reddy by over half a million votes. Interestingly, the Congress Minister then routed, D.L. Ravindra Reddy (taunted as \u201cDeposit Loss Reddy\u201d during that campaign), is now out of the government. He has quit following the new round of factional warfare that the latest debacle has brought on. That war has seen the Chief Minister and party factional leaders clashing in direct and indirect battles. The Anti-Corruption Bureau raids on the liquor lobby across the State are seen by many as a part of this war. The facts unearthed by the raids, whatever their reason, are fascinating. Close to 50 per cent of liquor shop-owners in the district of Vizianagaram turn out to be BPL card- holders. In reality, they are \u201c<i>benami</i>\u201d owners fronting for a very senior State Congress leader. In Anantapur, a BPL card-holder owns a Rs.570-crore cement company. Again, a front for a Congress leader whose son and daughter-in-law joined the board of the owning company while that leader was a minister. Meanwhile, CBI charges against Jagan Reddy in the illegal assets case, so far at least, do not appear to be helping the ruling party. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>In Maharashtra</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAnd now there's 18 more seats in Andhra Pradesh for which bypolls must be held within months. All but one of these were held by Congressmen who resigned to join Jagan Reddy. One was vacated by Chiranjeevi who has gone to the Rajya Sabha. Nine of these are in coastal Andhra, eight in Rayalaseema and just one in Telangana. Defeats in many of these could further carve up an already paralysed party. What's happening to the TDP in the State is also interesting. The perennial corporate-media favourite, Chandrababu Naidu, is floundering. The TDP failed to win a single one of the seven seats in the bypolls. It also lost its deposit in three of those. In several of the 18 seats for which bypolls will soon be due, the TDP and the Congress could be fighting for second place. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe crumbling of the Congress' A.P. bastion will have a wider national fallout for that party. The more so when it is losing ground to its ally, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra, another vital State for the Congress. Whether in the municipal councils, corporations, <i>panchayat samitis </i>or the <i>zilla parishads</i>, all recent local body polls have seen the NCP fare better. In the <i>zilla parishads </i>of this huge State, there are just two among 27 which went to the polls \u2014 Sindhudurg and Latur \u2014 where the party is in a position to rule on its own. The trends must worry the Congress. It appears Muslims and dalits \u2014 both crucial to that party's base \u2014 have not voted for it in their usual numbers. Maharashtra (48) and Andhra Pradesh (42) account for 90 Lok Sabha seats. With the Congress holding more than half of these, changing vote patterns in these States matter a lot to that party. The Congress holds 17 Lok Sabha seats from Maharashtra. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe party can draw comfort from the fact that its main rival, the BJP, is not doing much better across most of the country. And in fact, the Congress-led Democratic Front (DF) in Maharashtra has been losing vote-share but winning elections thanks to the disarray of the rival front. For instance, the split in the Shiv Sena has helped the Congress pull off unlikely victories. However, the period has also seen the NCP gain ground from the Congress. This will not help at bargaining time in 2014. When the Congress will be facing the heat from another ally in another State where it once had about 40 per cent of the vote on its own, West Bengal. But the bypolls to 18 seats in A.P. won't wait till then to cause problems. Those begin immediately in what 36 months ago was the strongest Congress bastion in the country. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i>psainath@mtnl.net.in</i>\n</p>", "date": "April 3, 2012", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/small-bypolls-big-signals/article3273995.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Andhra Pradesh bypolls", "AP Lok Sabha seats", "AP Congress", "Andhra Pradesh politics", "Congress party", "national politics"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Food security \u2014 of APL, BPL & IPL"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nThere was irony in the timing of the petrol price decontrol order. The decision, which also covered major hikes in diesel and kerosene prices, and affects hundreds of millions of people, came even as Manmohan Singh advised world leaders in Toronto on the need for \u201cinclusive growth.\u201d And while we are still debating \u201cfood security\u201d and how best that should be achieved in law. It came while food price inflation edges towards 17 per cent and general inflation is in double digits. Who are we trying to \u201cinclude\u201d in that growth?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNo less tragic was the media's reaction to the price decontrol. Even as Cabinet Ministers sought to distance themselves from it, the editorials mostly reeked of triumphalism: \u201cFree at Last,\u201d screamed one. \u201cA bold, welcome move,\u201d shrilled another headline. With rare exceptions, the edits \u2014 in contrast to the response of millions to Monday's bandh \u2014 showed yet again how far the mass media are from mass reality.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMost of the time, as the late Murray Kempton used to say, the job editorial writers do, is to \u201ccome down from the hills after the battle is over and shoot the wounded.\u201d The media have done that definition proud. There's even been an editorial on Bhopal in the same month that didn't wait for that battle to be over. It finds the villains of Bhopal to be the \u201cactivist industry that continues to milk the tragedy.\u201d And mourns the real tragedy: that \u201cany corporation, across the world, would be forced to think twice before proudly announcing to its shareholders that it has set up an ancillary unit in Bhopal.\u201d It does not once mention the words \u201cUnion Carbide.\u201d Roll over Kempton. The shooting's on.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe early protests against the price rise got short shrift in the media. In the largest English daily, it earned a couple of stories spanning a modest few inches across three or four columns. The same daily twice devoted a full page \u2014 without an ad \u2014 on successive days to the death by suicide of a fashion model in Mumbai. Also, passing off without much comment this week \u2014 the elevation of our Food and Agriculture Minister to the post of president of the International Cricket Council. At a time when the entire nation is focussed on the issue of food prices and food security.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMr. Pawar is quoted as saying (AFP, New Delhi, July 2) that he would request the Prime Minister to lessen his ministerial workload. \u201cI may suggest having more hands to help me. I had asked for three Ministers but they have given me only one,\u201d he told journalists. \u201c... If I request to reduce some of my work, we may find some solution.\u201d However, he does promise us that \u201cI won't allow my work in the government to suffer.\u201d That's reassuring. Maybe it's time for the Prime Minister to extend inclusive growth to bring the Food and Agriculture Minister into food and agriculture. (Or we could include cricket in that sector.) Four Ministers in the same field would be truly inclusive.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nYet the fuel price decontrol will profoundly affect the prices of just about everything. At a time of already spiralling food costs. Punctuated by periodic claims that \u201cit should come down within a couple of months,\u201d from Ministers and UPA hacks.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNow comes the news that the food security bill may be set for a radical overhaul. I guess that is welcome \u2014 it can't be worse than the early attempts at drafting one. Take for instance the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers held in February. They were to \u201cdiscuss the enactment of the proposed National Food Security Bill.\u201d The first thing the EGoM came up with was this gem. 2.1 (a) \u201cThe definition of Food Security should be limited to the specific issue of foodgrains (wheat and rice) and be delinked from the larger issue of nutritional security.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nFood security delinked from nutritional security? Note that the same line concedes nutritional security is \u201cthe larger issue.\u201d Why then the need to delink the two?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIs 35 kg of rice at Rs. 3 a kilo (for a section of the population) food security? Are there no other determinants of food security? Like health, nutrition, livelihoods, jobs, food prices? Can we even delink the fuel price hike from discussions on food security? Or from the wilful gutting of the public distribution system? Or from the havoc wrought by the ever-growing futures trade in wheat, pulses, edible oils and more?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe truth is the government seeks ways to spend less and less on the very food security it talks about. Hunger is defined not by how many people suffer it, but by how many the government is willing to pay for. Hence the endless search for a lower BPL figure. To the government's great dismay, all three officially-constituted committees have turned up estimates of poverty higher than its own. Even the Tendulkar committee, closest to the ruling elite's worldview, raises the estimate of rural poverty to 42 per cent. (On a weak and fragile basis, it is true. But still higher than the government's count.)\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe BPL Expert group headed by N.C. Saxena raises that to around 50 per cent. While the report of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector states on its first page that 836 million Indians (77 per cent of our people) live on Rs. 20 a day or less. Accepting that, for instance, would mean a few thousand crores more in spending on the hungry. The official line is simple. Since we cannot afford to feed all the hungry, there must only be as many hungry as we can afford to feed.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMost dishonest of all is the \u201cthere-is-no-money\u201d line. The country spends Rs. 10,000 crore on a new airport. There's Rs. 40,000 crore or more for the Commonwealth Games. There's Rs. 60,000 crore happily lost in the spectrum scam. There's Rs. 500,000 crore in write-offs under just three heads for the super-rich and the corporate sector in the current Union budget. But funds for the hungry are hard to come by. What would it cost to universalise the PDS? Pravin Jha and Nilachal Acharya estimate that if rice/wheat were made available to all Indians at Rs. 3 a kilo, it would add Rs.84,399 crore to the food subsidy in coming budgets. That's about one-sixth of the tax write-offs for the wealthy in this year's budget. (Other estimates place the added expenditure each year at no more than Rs. 45,000 crore).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWhat will be the costs of not finding the money \u2014 in a country which ranks at 66 among 88 in the Global Hunger Index? In a nation whose child malnourishment record is worse than that of sub-Saharan Africa? A country now ranking 134 in the United Nations Human Development Index below Bhutan and Laos?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe same country that has 49 dollar billionaires in the Forbes list. (Many of whom receive government freebies in diverse forms. Some for their IPL involvements). If a government will not even try to ensure that no citizen goes hungry, should it remain in power? Or should it, at the very least, state honestly that the food security of every Indian is neither its aim nor its intent? Why tag \u2018food security' to a bill that will legitimise the opposite? How can we call something a \u2018right' if everyone does not have it?\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nA disclosure: I was a member of the BPL Expert Group. In a note annexed to that report, I argued that in four sectors \u2014 food, healthcare, education and decent work \u2014 access had to be universal. That flows from the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution. The rights of our people are based on their being citizens. Not on their ability to pay. Not on their being BPL or APL (or even IPL). Rights, by definition, are universal and indivisible.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWill the features of the government's proposed food security bill take the Directive Principles forward? Or will it weaken them? Diluting constitutional rights and presenting the watered down mix as progressive legislation is fraud. The only PDS that will work is a universal one. It is only in those States that have the closest thing to a universal system \u2014 Kerala and Tamil Nadu \u2014 where the PDS has functioned best.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNow there's talk of an \u201cexperiment\u201d making access to food (that is, mainly wheat and rice) \u201cuniversal\u201d in about 150 districts. While this might be a step forward in thinking, it could prove a misstep in practice. This is \u201ctargeting\u201d in other clothes. It could collapse as foodgrain from districts that are \u201cuniversal\u201d migrate to districts that are not. Better to go that final mile. Universalise.\n</p> <p class=\"body\"></p>", "date": "July 6, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/food-security-of-apl-bpl-ipl/article501693.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Food security bill", "BPL Expert Group", "Public Distribution System", "United Nations Human Development Index"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Cattle class: native vs exotic"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nVisitors flow in and out of Chandran Master's compound in P. Vemballur, Thrissur, Kerala. Students, teachers, trainees in animal husbandry work and even officials walk around like it's a public space. And in some ways, it is. People come a distance to see his 22 cows and two bulls \u2014 mostly from rare indigenous breeds. Also, the many kinds of mango, bamboo and fish he has cultivated, again species native to India. The former English teacher also boasts a classic Kathiawari horse and several native breeds of poultry. But the star attractions are the tiny Vechur \u2014 \u201cthe world's smallest cow\u201d \u2014 and other dwarf varieties of Kerala cattle.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe visitors' interest also reflects a growing concern in the State about the fate of domestic breeds of cattle and other livestock. Like elsewhere, a strong emphasis on crossbred cattle that aimed at higher milk production also saw a sharp decline in native animals. There is now a serious debate on the results of that approach. Kerala's cattle population declined by around 48 per cent between 1996 and 2007.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nDr. R. Vijayakumar, Director of Kerala's Animal Husbandry Department (AHD), says the State's new breeding policy \u201climits exotic [that is, non-native] germplasm to 50 per cent of cattle. We are now also propagating native breeds. We even conduct artificial insemination with the semen of native bulls.\u201d And while the number of animals may have fallen between 1996 and 2007, \u201cmilk productivity of cows in the State rose in that period. From an average of six litres a day to 8.5 litres, even as crossbreeds came to account for 87 per cent of Kerala's cattle.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, the cost of milk production is much higher with the crossbreeds. The feed requirement of native dwarf breeds like Vechur and Kasargode are very minor. Their feed-to-milk conversion is very good. The crossbreeds are high-maintenance animals and are disease-prone. \u201cSee this Vadakara Dwarf,\u201d says Chandran Master. \u201cI doubt I spend five to ten rupees on her feed daily. Still she gives me three to four litres. But the quality of her milk is highly prized and I could get Rs.50 a litre for it. So even in that way, the benefit is greater. There is no high standard of feed required either. Kitchen scraps and leftovers can be used. And they don't require special sheds or anything.\u201d He, however, does not sell milk. He does sell \u201cvery few calves each year when the numbers exceed my capacity to manage.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOf the Vechur, he says its milk has medicinal qualities recorded by Ayurveda ages ago. In more recent times, studies at the Kerala Agricultural University have also shown the percentage of fats and total solids of the Vechur cow to be higher than that found in crossbred cows. The smaller size of the fat globules in the Vechur's milk makes it more suitable for infants and the sick.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAHD Director R. Vijayakumar says the decline of native species had many causes. Not just the castrations of \u2018non-descript' varieties that had occurred in a much earlier period. He points to \u201cthe trend towards cash crops which brought about a decline in animal-based agriculture and to a younger generation of farmers with no time or patience for rearing large animals \u2014 they prefer smaller ruminants. And to a greater interest in crossbreeds due to their higher milk productivity.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nBut costs and maintenance are another matter. \u201cBefore I switched to local breeds in 1994,\u201d says Chandran Master, \u201cI had three crossbreds, including one Swiss Brown. I had to spend up to Rs.400 a day on each. The feed was very costly and over Rs.200 a day. Pellet feed, rice powder, wheat powder, oil cake, green grass, it's endless. They would fall ill all the time and the vet was here every week, with each visit costing me Rs.150 apart from the expense of arranging a vehicle for him.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSince making his switch: \u201cNo vet has attended my cows for 17 years. And I have not even insured a single one of them. These are hardy, healthy creatures.\u201d And several experts do point out that India's native cattle (<i>Bos indicus</i>) have evolved to cope with the climate and to \u201cwithstand diseases, parasites and calve easily without human assistance.\u201d Scientists like Dr. Sosamma Iype, who pioneered the revival of the Vechur at KAU, also point out that these dwarf animals \u201chave good resistance to foot and mouth disease and mastitis. Both, diseases which plague crossbred cows in Kerala. Vechur cattle also have a far lower incidence of respiratory infections.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMost livestock owners in Kerala are either small or marginal farmers or even landless. The State has the highest percentage of crossbreeds in the country. And while its average milk yield has risen, production is far below demand. The State is not amongst the top producers in the country. Feed utilisation per litre of milk is also one of the highest in India. Critics say it's wrong to ignore the steep fall in cattle numbers and native breeds that has hurt the State, alongside decades-old policies that made it illegal for a farmer to keep any bull without a licence for it. That licence is only granted at the level of State Director of the AHD.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nTechnically, Chandran Master and others are breaking the law. But surely the State has no way of knowing whether a farmer is keeping an \u201cillegal\u201d bull? \u201cA hostile panchayat can make life hell for a farmer,\u201d says one expert. \u201cIf that farmer is at odds with the ruling outfit of that panchayat, they can keep him in court for months.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i>Haritha Bhoomi</i> (Green Earth) a journal on agriculture recently summed up the red tape involved in permissions of any kind: Say a farmer wishes to exceed the limit of six large animals and 20 head of poultry, even by a minor number. He needs clearances from the panchayat to just start the process. If you exceed the quota, you have to go to the Pollution Control Board. Depending on the size of the establishment you wish to build, you will need certificates from the District Town Planner. Perhaps even from the State Chief Town Planner. Manage to get these done and you have to prepare a technical report for the panchayat and get three or four certificates from them. Then the farmer must get clearances from the district medical officer to whom he has to submit NOCs from all residents within 100 metres of his planned farm.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOn my first visit to Chandran Master's home I had run into a Livestock Inspector (LI) from another region. Wishing to remain unnamed, he told me \u201cOn most of my visits I see the problems faced by the crossbreeds. They fall ill with the slightest change in climate. They cannot take the heat.\u201d Chandran Master chipped in: \u201cYou cannot sleep one night peacefully. Crossbreds can't stand ten minutes of rain. With local breeds, you don't even need cowsheds.\u201d The LI nodded: \u201cIf I keep a cow, it will be a Vechur.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n(PS: Following <a href=\"http://thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/article2775282.ece\" target=\"_blank\">Thursday's story </a>in <i>The Hindu</i>, the Sahabaghya Vikash Abhiyan, a community-based body deeply involved in Kalahandi's agriculture, has announced it will gift Chandran Master two calves of the rare Khariar breed.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Holy cow! Small is beautiful"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nWhen Kerala Agriculture Minister K.P. Mohanan paid Chandran \u2018Master' Rs.15,000 for a Vechur calf last September, he was rewarding a conscious law-breaker. Yet, the Minister, on behalf of the Livestock Development Board, was doing the right thing \u2014 and everyone approved. Chandran \u2018Master' and other intrepid souls have helped keep Kerala's unique cattle varieties alive. This, despite antiquated laws that made the breeding of such animals by farmers illegal without a licence from the State's Director of Animal Husbandry. And through some years when livestock inspectors relentlessly castrated the bulls of these \u2018inferior' breeds, boosting the dominance of crossbred cattle. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis flowed partly from the idea that higher milk yields, regardless of costs and consequences, were all that mattered. In what could mark an attitude shift, the State is now paying rebel farmers for resisting its own depredations. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nChandran Master keeps 24 head of cattle, mostly rare indigenous breeds, in the compound of his home in P. Vemballur village of Thrissur district. These include the tiny Vechur cow, symbol of Kerala's domestic cattle crisis. By 2000, the animal was on the FAO's World Watch List of Domestic Animal Diversity, in its \u2018Critical-Maintained Breeds List.' A variety makes that list \u201cwhen the number of breeding females\u201d is 100 or less. Or when \u201cthe total number of breeding males\u201d is five or less. Or if the overall count is 120 or less, and falling. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Chandran Master's home, the count is rising. \u201cI gave the Livestock Board five Vechur calves,\u201d he says proudly. And got two Gir calves and Rs. 45,000 in return. A tiny Vechur calf had been born \u2014 in his compound \u2014 just six hours before we arrived there. Her mother, a fine animal, is 82 cm high. The Vechur is the world's smallest cattle breed. November 2010 saw Diana, a 77-cm Vechur (also from Thrissur district), enter the Guinness Book of Records as the smallest cow in the world. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-8000/smallest-cow-(height)/\" target=\"_blank\">(http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-8000/smallest-cow-(height)/) </a>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMostly, this breed averages around 90 cm in height and about 130 kg in weight. It yields up to 3 litres of milk a day and requires very little by way of feed or maintenance. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAlongside the \u201cworld's smallest cow\u201d are the Vadakara Dwarf, the Kasargode Dwarf, the High Range Dwarf and other indigenous cattle breeds. The 72-year-old former school teacher scoffs at the official mind-set on cattle. \u201cThe cow for them is just a milk-production machine\u201d he says. \u201cTheir view has no room for the composition and quality of the milk. Much less for the role of cattle in agriculture and in a farmer's life. None at all for the impact on the environment, diversity or community.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nNambiyandra Ayyappan Chandran \u2018Master' is an award-winning former English teacher who worked 36 years in Kerala and Oman. He has \u201cpledged what remains of my life\u201d to conserving breeds of <i>Bos indicus</i> (native Indian cattle). His living room sports a huge photo of the Rs.15,000 cheque from the Kerala Livestock Development Board. \u201cRoughly what I lose each month on my passion.\u201d But Chandran Master is okay with that. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cMy cows,\u201d he points out, \u201care zero maintenance \u2014 they are native and do not need a high-input diet.\u201d But he also tries to grow 30 types of mangoes and an equal number of bamboo varieties, all indigenous. Also a few native kinds of fish and many traditional plants. His son tries to bridge the household deficit through high-earning horticulture. If the family converted some of its 18 acres to real estate, he would be rich, but Chandran Master has \u201ca mission and a passion.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cMalayalis take the easy way out in everything,\u201d Minister K.P. Mohanan had said while handing over the KLDB cheque. \u201cHence, they have not taken pains to preserve native breeds such as Vechur cow and Kasargode Dwarf. Instead, they have gone for cross-bred varieties. Malayalis should be aware of a global movement for preservation of domestic breeds of animals.\u201d (<i>The Hindu</i>, Sept. 25, 2011). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, native breeds were ruined not by people but by official policies over a long time. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nKerala's anti-indigenous drive across decades was one factor in the collapse of its native cattle numbers. Livestock Census figures show a drop of 48 per cent in the total cattle population between 1996 and 2007. But it goes back further, to when the Kerala Livestock Improvement Act of 1961 gave \u201cthe licensing officer\u201d the \u201cpower to order castration of bulls.\u201d And farmers ordered to castrate their bulls had 30 days to do so. An amended Act in 1968 also promised fines and imprisonment for those failing to comply. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nDr. Sosamma Iype, retired Professor, Animal Breeding and Genetics from Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) was a pioneer in reviving the Vechur breed. She and Dr. Abraham Varkey, retired Professor of Veterinary Surgery, make this point. \u201cOn the one hand, you needed a licence from the State director of the Animal Husbandry Department to be able to keep a bull. On the other, an inspector finding such a bull [Vechur or any other kind] was bound by orders to castrate it! So no one ever sought a licence!\u201d The castrations drove some native breeds to near extinction. (Similar drives occurred in other parts of the country, notably Orissa. There, an insane project aimed at boosting milk production, all but wiped out the Khariar Bull, the best breed of the Kalahandi region by 1980. It also transformed what was then a milk-surplus region, into a milk-deficit one). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nStill, the Vechur survived. Partly, says Professor Varkey, \u201cbecause a few escaped, being in regions too remote or forested for the vets to reach. And partly because Temple Bulls were exempted for religious reasons.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThey also survive because of people like Sosamma Iype. She and others were part of a drive to conserve local breeds that saw the founding of the Vechur Conservation Trust in 1998. \u201cThe search for survivors, though, began in 1988,\u201d says Prof. Iype. \u201cAnd with the help of a student search team headed by Anil Zachariah, we found eight by the end of that year. We got Rs. 51,000 sanctioned by the then Vice Chancellor of KAU to buy the eight animals and provide them with feed.\u201d Her work at KAU saw a turnaround in the fate of the Vechur breed and earned it wide recognition. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBut don't the crossbreeds outclass native breeds in milk yield? \u201cThat can't be the only yardstick,\u201d says Prof. Iype. \u201cCheck the milk yields against input costs. The expense of the crossbreeds is enormous. They are far more prone to outbreaks of illness as we were reminded again in 2009 during a severe outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease. There are indeed several farmers who prefer crossbreeds as an income source, through sale of milk. There are also 25-30 per cent, who prefer smaller, less costly animals. These households look at it from the point of view of home consumption, quality of milk and food security. \u201cThe Trust today promotes the cause of not only the Vechur, but other Kerala breeds of cattle, goats, pigs and ducks as well. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBack in his home in P. Vemballur village, Chandran Master wants to know: \u201cWhen are you going to help me get a Khariar Bull from Orissa?\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i>In response to readers' queries, we publish the contact address for Chandran Master:\n</i></p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i><b>Chandran Master\n</b></i></p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i><b>Village P.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Of luxury cars and lowly tractors"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">When businessmen from Aurangabad in the backward Marathwada region bought 150 Mercedes Benz luxury cars worth Rs. 65 crore at one go in October, it grabbed media attention. The top public sector bank, State Bank of India, offered the buyers loans of over Rs. 40 crore. \u201cThis,\u201d says Devidas Tulzapurkar, president of the Aurangabad district bank employees association, \u201cat an interest rate of 7 per cent.\u201d A top SBI official said the bank was \u201cproud to be part of this deal,\u201d and would \u201ccontinue to scout for similar deals in the future.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The value of the Mercedes deal equals the annual income of tens of thousands of rural Marathwada households. And countless farmers in Maharashtra struggle to get any loans from formal sources of credit. It took roughly a decade and tens of thousands of suicides before Indian farmers got loans at 7 per cent interest \u2014 many, in theory only. Prior to 2005, those who got any bank loans at all shelled out between 9 and 12 per cent. Several were forced to take non-agricultural loans at even higher rates of interest. Buy a Mercedes, pay 7 per cent interest. Buy a tractor, pay 12 per cent. The hallowed micro-finance institutions (MFIs) do worse. There, it's smaller sums at interest rates of between 24 and 36 per cent or higher.</p> <p class=\"body\">Starved of credit, peasants turned to moneylenders and other informal sources. Within 10 years from 1991, the number of Indian farm households in debt almost doubled from 26 per cent to 48.6 per cent. A crazy underestimate but an official number. Many policy-driven disasters hit farmers at the same time. Exploding input costs in the name of \u2018market-based prices.' Crashing prices for their commercial crops, often rigged by powerful traders and corporations. Slashing of investment in agriculture. A credit squeeze as banks moved away from farm loans to fuelling upper middle class lifestyles. Within the many factors driving over two lakh farmers to suicide in 13 years, indebtedness and the credit squeeze rank high. (And MFIs are now among the squeezers).</p> <p class=\"body\">What remained of farm credit was hijacked. A devastating piece in <i>The Hindu</i> (Aug. 13) showed us how. Almost half the total \u201cagricultural credit\u201d in the State of Maharashtra in 2008 was disbursed not by rural banks but by urban and metro branches. Over 42 per cent of it in just Mumbai \u2014 stomping ground of large corporations rather than of small farmers.</p> <p class=\"body\">Even as the media celebrate our greatest car deal ever as a sign of \u201crural resurgence,\u201d the subject of many media stories, comes the latest data of the National Crime Records Bureau. These show a sharp increase in farm suicides in 2009 with at least 17,368 farmers killing themselves in the year of \u201crural resurgence.\u201d That's over 7 per cent higher than in 2008 and the worst numbers since 2004. This brings the total farm suicides since 1997 to 216,500. While all suicides have multiple causes, their strong concentration within regions and among cash crop farmers is an alarming and dismal trend.</p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB, a wing of the Union Home Ministry, has been tracking farm suicide data since 1995. However, researchers mostly use their data from 1997 onwards. This is because the 1995 and 1996 data are incomplete. The system was new in 1995 and some big States such as Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan sent in no numbers at all that year. (In 2009, the two together saw over 1,900 farm suicides). By 1997, all States were reporting and the data are more complete.</p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB data end at 2009 for now. But we can assume that 2010 has seen at least 16,000 farmers' suicides. (After all, the yearly average for the last six years is 17,104). Add this 16,000 to the total 2,16,500. Also add the incomplete 1995 and 1996 numbers \u2014 that is 24,449 suicides. This brings the 1995-2010 total to 2,56,949. Reflect on this figure a moment.</p> <p class=\"body\">It means over a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide since 1995. It means the largest wave of recorded suicides in human history has occurred in this country in the past 16 years. It means one-and-a-half million human beings, family members of those killing themselves, have been tormented by the tragedy. While millions more face the very problems that drove so many to suicide. It means farmers in thousands of villages have seen their neighbours take this incredibly sad way out. A way out that more and more will consider as despair grows and policies don't change. It means the heartlessness of the Indian elite is impossible to imagine, leave alone measure.</p> <p class=\"body\">Note that these numbers are gross underestimates to begin with. Several large groups of farmers are mostly excluded from local counts. Women, for instance. Social and other prejudice means that, most times, a woman farmer killing herself is counted as suicide \u2014 not as a farmer's suicide. Because the land is rarely in a woman's name.</p> <p class=\"body\">Then there is the plain fraud that some governments resort to. Maharashtra being the classic example. The government here has lied so many times that it contradicts itself thrice within a week. In May this year, for instance, three \u2018official' estimates of farm suicides in the worst-hit Vidarbha region varied by 5,500 per cent. The lowest count being just six in four months (See \u201cHow to be an eligible suicide,\u201d <i>The Hindu</i>, May 13, 2010).</p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB figure for Maharashtra as a whole in 2009 is 2,872 farmers' suicides. So it remains the worst State for farm suicides for the tenth year running. The \u2018decline' of 930 that this figure represents would be joyous if true. But no State has worked harder to falsify reality. For 13 years, the State has seen a nearly unrelenting rise. Suddenly, there's a drop of 436 and 930 in 2008 and 2009. How? For almost four years now, committees have functioned in Vidarbha's crisis districts to dismiss most suicides as \u2018non-genuine.' What is truly frightening is the Maharashtra government's notion that fixing the numbers fixes the problem.</p> <p class=\"body\">Yet that problem is mounting. Perhaps the State most comparable to Maharashtra in terms of population is West Bengal. Though its population is less by a few million, it has more farmers. Both States have data for 15 years since 1995. Their farm suicide annual averages in three-five year periods starting then are revealing. Maharashtra's annual average goes up in each period. From 1,963 in the five years ending with 1999 to 3,647 by 2004. And scaling 3,858 by 2009. West Bengal's yearly average registers a gradual drop in each five-year period. From 1,454 in 1999 to 1,200 in 2004 to 1,014 by 2009. While it has more farmers, its farm suicide average for the past five years is less than a third of Maharashtra's. The latter's yearly average has almost doubled since 1999.</p> <p class=\"body\">The share of the Big 5 \u2018suicide belt' States \u2014 Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh \u2014 remains close to two-thirds of all farm suicides. Sadly 18 of 28 States reported higher farm suicide numbers in 2009. In some the rise was negligible. In others, not. Tamil Nadu showed the biggest increase of all States, going from 512 in 2008 to 1060 in 2009. Karnataka clocked in second with a rise of 545. And Andhra Pradesh saw the third biggest rise \u2014 309 more than in 2008. A few though did see a decline of some consequence in their farm suicide annual average figures for the last six years. Three \u2014 Karnataka, Kerala and West Bengal \u2014 saw their yearly average fall by over 350 in 2004-09 compared to the earlier seven years.</p> <p class=\"body\">Things will get worse if existing policies on agriculture don't change. Even States that have managed some decline across 13 years will be battered. Kerala, for instance, saw an annual average of 1,371 farm suicides between 1997 and 2003. From 2004-09, its annual average was 1016 \u2014 a drop of 355. Yet Kerala will suffer greatly in the near future. Its economy is the most globalised of any State. Most crops are cash crops. Any volatility in the global prices of coffee, pepper, tea, vanilla, cardamom or rubber will affect the State. Those prices are also hugely controlled at the global level by a few corporations.</p> <p class=\"body\">Already bludgeoned by the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), Kerala now has to contend with the one we've gotten into with ASEAN. And an FTA with the European Union is also in the offing. Kerala will pay the price. Even prior to 2004, the dumping of the so-called \u201cSri Lankan pepper\u201d (mostly pepper from other countries brought in through Sri Lanka) ravaged the State. Now, we've created institutional frameworks for such dumping. Economist Professor K. Nagaraj, author of the biggest study of farm suicides in India, says: \u201cThe latest data show us that the agrarian crisis has not relented, not gone away.\u201d The policies driving it have also not gone away.</p>", "date": "December 27, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/of-luxury-cars-and-lowly-tractors/article995828.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["P.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["When a week is a long time"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\n\u201cMy collections have fallen by over 50 per cent as compared to last year,\u201d says a despondent Prashant Balki in Devdhari where we run into him patrolling the village on his motorbike. Young Balki is a collection agent for the Wani Urban Bank in Yavatmal district. His job is to collect small sums each day from villagers in Ralegaon taluka who join the daily savings scheme of the bank. (Some banks call these tiny deposits \u201cpygmy\u201d saving schemes.) People have been badly hit by the drought and crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cThey find even small amounts hard to give.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d says Gulshan Ghai, a small storekeeper who\u2019s walking by. \u201cThe price rise has been hurting people badly for quite some time. Now they\u2019re staring at crop failure.\u201d Ghai is also a farmer owning seven acres. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Jarur village of Ghattanji taluka, Moreshwar Waitale is discovering that when he shifted from cotton to soybean four seasons ago, he traded one volatility for another. \u201cThree seasons, soybean did okay and I escaped the kind of losses I suffered on cotton. So this year I brought all my 15 acres under soybean. Now it\u2019s failing totally.\u201d Cotton, while costlier to cultivate, is also hardier in the kind of weather Vidharbha finds itself facing. \u201cSoybean is likely to go under much faster,\u201d say farmers here. It is also riddled with pest in some parts of the district. The consensus is that late rains will help with fodder but not too much with crop yields.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMonsoon failure hits Vidharbha, certainly Yavatmal, at a critical time. Some things had changed in this district. A vigorous agitation \u2014 which saw hundreds of farmers incessantly beating drums outside banks \u2014 and a more receptive administration \u2014 saw Yavatmal actually cross its crop loan targets for the first in years. \u201cAgainst the target of Rs. 520 crores,\u201d says District collector Sanjay Deshmukh, \u201cwe touched Rs. 560 crores.\u201d This was impressive and Yavatmal was the only district to do so in Vidharbha. The irony, he says, is that a drought could see the recipients of those loans turn defaulters next year. This is a genuine fear. Indebtedness, always high in this region, is again on the rise. Vidharbha\u2019s problems did not arise from a drought, but will worsen with it. The next week will be the longest. A tense wait for the rains.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThat the pressure is already on is evident in the fall in Balki\u2019s daily savings collections and the distress sale of cattle in the villages. \u201cPeople are not even taking their cattle to sell them in the main markets,\u201d says Kishor Tiwari. \u201cTrucks headed for the abattoir are picking them up right at the villages.\u201d His organisation, the Vidharbha Jan Andolan Samiti spearheaded the stir against the banks. \u201cMainly, those sold at the market under normal conditions would be for draught and milch purposes. Those sold in this situation are often headed for the slaughter house.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Collector believes 80 per cent of this season\u2019s crop can \u201cstill be saved if there are good rains within the week.\u201d He also believes that a lot can be done to secure a better rabi season. Like many here, he supports the idea of digging a pond on every farm. That too, could help enlarge \u201cthe area under rabi from around 10 per cent to perhaps 30 per cent of the total 9 lakh hectares under cultivation in kharif.\u201d The union rural development ministry\u2019s latest announcement now allows, in theory at least, such ponds to be created on private farms through the NREGs. Meanwhile the district has to contend with a sinking water table and several talukas where rainfall has been sparse to nil for three weeks. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn the midst of the chaos, impending and real, we run into one of Yavatmal\u2019s truly curious characters. He\u2019s called \u201cLachchu Patel\u201d but his real name is Lakshman Rao Bollenwar. He is of Telugu origin but his people have been here for generations. Lachchu\u2019s family are not vegetarians. He has a poor opinion of the VHP and particularly of its gaushalas or cow shelters. \u201cThese people are not farmers,\u201d he scoffs \u201cand they know little about looking after cattle.\u201d He on the other hand, is a skilled big farmer who does know cattle. \u201cCows are central to farming life,\u201d he says and he does not mean that in religious terms. \u201cI love cows.\u201d So much so that he buys up cows bound for slaughter and cares for them. He presently shelters over a hundred such animals \u2014 apart from other livestock.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nLachchu became famous by intercepting cows due for slaughter on the roads, in the villages, \u201ceven at the butcher\u2019s.\u201d Not with violence or threats, but as a buyer. And the truck drivers carting cows to the abattoirs know a good touch when they see one. They stop at his house en route. \u201cKnowing,\u201d says one of his friends, \u201cthat they will get a much better rate from Lachchu than from the slaughter house. Earlier, he chased the trucks, now they come uninvited to his place.\u201d But how on earth does he afford feeding them, big farmer though he might be? That\u2019s where his skills and acumen come in. \u201cAbout a dozen of these animals aren\u2019t so bad,\u201d says Lachchu. From these, after restoring them to health, he gets 40 litres of milk or more daily, which he can sell and make up to Rs. 800 a day on average. Or well over Rs. 20,000 a month. That still isn\u2019t enough to care for such a large herd on the scale that Lachchu does. So he puts in the rest himself. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, we press him, you cannot endlessly acquire new head of cattle, that too in bad shape? \u201cEach year, I give away about 30 to 40 when I\u2019ve got them healthy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd since that\u2019s about how many I pick up each year, the number remains roughly constant. All I ask is that the poor or needy family I give them to promises to keep the cow and not ever send it to the abattoir. It adds to their income and security. Farmers need cows. Cows need farmers.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nOn the highways, though, are still vans headed for abattoirs. Evidence of farms in distress, losing the cows they need. </p>", "date": "August 20, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/when-a-week-is-a-long-time/article5861.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Sainath", "drought", "monsoon", "deficit", "rain", "rainfall", "food security", "Yavatmal", "Maharashtra", "cattle", "distress", "sale"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The numbers game in Andhra Pradesh"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The numbers in the by-elections in Andhra Pradesh indicate massive shifts. In 2009, the Congress won 16 of the 18 Assembly seats that went to the polls on June 12 this year. Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam Party (PRP) won the other two. Add up the votes of these two parties in 2009 and on paper they seem an invincible combine. The two got a total of over 16 lakh votes in the 18 seats. Their combined vote was higher than that of the next force (Telugu Desam Party) by over 40,000 votes, in some cases even by 50,000. And remember that the PRP subsequently merged in the Congress. Yet, this time, their merged force won just two of those seats and lost 62 per cent of their combined vote of 2009. The TDP did not win a single seat but fared better in retaining its core vote. It lost around 11 per cent compared to its 2009 performance. The Congress (post-PRP merger) came second in six seats, third in nine and fifth in one (Parakal in Telangana, a seat it won in 2009). The Congress lost deposit in four seats.</p> <p class=\"body\">The YSR Congress obtained more votes than the Congress and the TDP combined in each of nine of the 18 seats. Those are: Polavaram (ST), Prathipadu (SC), Ongole, Rajampet, Kodur (SC), Rayachoti, Allagadda, Anantapur (Urban), and Parakal. Its total vote across the 18 seats (and in the lone Lok Sabha seat) is also higher than that of the Congress-TDP totals taken together. In Rayadurgam, the (self-declared) richest candidate ever to have filed an affidavit (TDP's Deepak Reddy, Rs. 6,800 crore) lost by over 32,000 votes. Even Tirupati, Chiranjeevi's own seat which he resigned in March this year to go to the Rajya Sabha, was lost to the YSRC by nearly 18,000 votes.</p> <p class=\"body\">In Nellore, the Congress, which won the Lok Sabha seat there in 2009 by nearly 55,000 votes, lost to the YSRC by over 2.91 lakh votes in a huge shift. The YSRC, which won 15 Assembly seats, took seven by margins of over 30,000. Those are: Polavaram, Udayagiri, Rayadurgam, Kodur, Rajampet, Allagadda and Rayachoti. (The last by over 55.000 votes). It won a further three by more than over 20,000 votes: Ongole, Anantapur (Urban) and Yemmiganur. And took three by margins of over 15,000: Prathipadu, Macherla and Tirupati. The TDP came second in nine seats and third in the remaining nine.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Farm suicides rise in Maharashtra, State still leads the list"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nWith a figure of at least 14,027 in 2011, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the total number of farm suicides since 1995 has touched 2,70, 940. The State of Maharashtra shows a rise in numbers yet again, logging 3,337 against 3,141 farmers\u2019 suicides the previous year (and 2,872 in 2009). This, despite heavy massaging of data at the State level for years now, even re-defining of the term \u201cfarmer\u201d itself. And despite an orchestrated (and expensive) campaign in the media and other forums by governments and major seed corporations to show that their efforts had made things a lot better. Maharashtra remains the worst single State for farm suicides for over a decade now. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe total number of farmers who have taken their own lives in Maharashtra since 1995 is closing in on 54,000. Of these 33,752 have occurred in nine years since 2003, at an annual average of 3,750. The figure for 1995-2002 was 20,066 at an average of 2,508. Significantly, the rise is occurring even as the farm population is shrinking a fact broadly true across the country. And more so in Maharashtra which has been urbanising more rapidly than most. The rising-suicides-shrinking-population equation suggests a major intensification of the pressures on the community. A better understanding of that, though, awaits the new farm population figures of the 2011 Census \u2014 not expected for many months from now. At present both national and State-wise farm suicide ratios (the number of farmers committing suicide per 100,000 farmers) are based on very outdated 2001 Census numbers. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Big five States</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe 2011 total gets dicey with Chhattisgarh\u2019s posting a figure of zero farm suicides. A zero figure should be great news. Except that Chhattisgarh had 7,777 farm suicides in the preceding five years, including 1,126 in 2010. It has been amongst the very worst States for such deaths for several years. The share of the worst (Big 5) states (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) as a percentage of total farm suicides, is now around 64 per cent. Even with Chhattisgarh showing a \u2018zero\u2019 figure, that is not much lower than the preceding five-year average for the Big 5 of close to 66 per cent. It could be that Chhattisgarh\u2019s figures have simply not made it to the NCRB in time. Otherwise, it means that the State is in fact a late entrant to the numbers massage parlour. Others have been doing it for years. Maharashtra since 2007, following the Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Vidarbha. Union Minister for Agriculture Sharad Pawar has strictly avoided using NCRB farm data in Parliament since 2008 because the data are unpleasant. (The union government however quotes the NCRB for all other categories). Now, governments are deep into fiddling the data that goes from the States to the NCRB. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWith the Big 5 also staring drought in the face, what numbers the coming season will throw up is most worrying. Within Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada have already been under great stress (which in turn pushes officials to step up data fiddles). If the numbers are re-calculated using the annual average of Chhattisgarh in the past five years, the national total of farm suicides for 2011 would be 15,582. And the share of the Big 5 (at 10,524) would be nearly 68 per cent. That\u2019s higher than the five-year average for those States, too. In 1995, the first time the NCRB tabulated farm suicide data, the Big 5 accounted for 56.04 per cent of all farm suicides. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn 2011, five States showed increases of over 50 farm suicides compared to 2010. These included Gujarat (55), Haryana (87), Madhya Pradesh (89), Tamil Nadu (82). Maharashtra alone showed a rise of 196. Nine States showed declines exceeding 50 farm suicides, of which Karnataka (485) and Andhra Pradesh (319) and West Bengal (186) claimed the biggest falls. That, of course, after Chhattisgarh, which claimed a decline of 1,126, with its zero farm suicides figure in 2011. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i><b>sainath@mtnl.net.in </b></i>\n</p>", "date": "July 3, 2012", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/farm-suicides-rise-in-maharashtra-state-still-leads-the-list/article3595351.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Vidarbha farmers", "farmers suicides", "NCRB"]}

And he spent another Rs.6,000 on cable television ads. These figures are clearly at odds with the unprecedented media coverage the Chief Minister got during the election campaign. <i>The Hindu</i> has gathered 47 full newspaper pages, many of them in colour, focused exclusively on Mr. Chavan, his leadership, his party and government. These appeared in large newspapers, including one ranking amongst India\u2019s highest circulation dailies. However, they were not marked as advertisements.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nBy his own account, candidate Chavan spent less than Rs. 7 lakh on his election campaign overall during the Assembly polls. The spending limit imposed on contestants is Rs. 10 lakh. Section 77 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 stipulates that candidates must submit their campaign expenses accounts to the district election officer within 30 days of the declaration of results. Apart from a signed statement and summary, the candidate must submit the accounts in the format of \u201cRegister for Maintenance of Day to Day Accounts of Election Expenditures by Contesting Candidates.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Chief Minister won the Bhokar Assembly seat of Maharashtra\u2019s Nanded district against an independent candidate by a margin of over one lakh votes.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i>The Hindu</i> has a copy of Mr. Chavan\u2019s account. Two RTI applications were filed by the newspaper\u2019s correspondents in Delhi and Mumbai. Two more were filed by Mr. Shivaji Gaikwad of the Kisan Sabha in Bhokar (Mr. Chavan\u2019s constituency) and by Mr. Gangadhar Gaikwad of the DYFI in Nanded. The Nanded district election officer responded most promptly and Mr. Gangadhar Gaikwad received the statement on Thursday. This is a significant step. Unlike the affidavits declaring their assets, the expenditure sheets of candidates do not mandatorily appear on the ECI\u2019s website.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nPerhaps they should. Mr. Chavan received astonishing media coverage during the campaign. The newspapers carrying those many full pages on him nowhere marked them as advertising. In other words, this material ran as \u2018news.\u2019 Had it been advertising, it would have cost crores of rupees.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMr. Chavan states that he placed six newspaper advertisements with that Rs. 5,379. All these were in a minor Marathi daily, Satyaprabha, in Nanded district. However, the flood of full pages on Mr. Chavan and his party, hailing this as the \u201cEra of Ashok,\u201d and the \u201cEra of Development,\u201d ran in Marathi newspapers like Lokmat.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["To fix BPL, nix CPL"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nOne Tendulkar makes the big scores. The other wrecks the averages. The Planning Commission clearly prefers Suresh to Sachin. Using Professor Tendulkar's methodology, it declares that there's been another massive fall in poverty. Yes, another (\u201cmore dramatic in the rural areas\u201d). \u201cRecord Fall in Poverty\u201d reads one headline. The record is in how many times you've seen the same headline over the years. And how many times poverty has collapsed, only to bounce back when the math is done differently. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/01024/Sainath-graphic_1024921a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Download PDF</b></a>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAnd so, a mere 29.9 per cent of India's population is now below the official poverty line (BPL). The figure was 37.2 per cent in 2004-05. The \u201cline\u201d is another story in itself, of course. But on the surface, rural poverty has declined by eight percentage points to log in at 33.8 per cent. That's down from 41.8 per cent in 2004-05. And urban poverty fell by 4.8 percentage points from 25.7 to 20.9 per cent in the same period. Millions have been dragged above the poverty line, without knowing it. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Undoing bogus methodology</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMedia amnesia fogs the \u201clowest-ever\u201d figures, though. These are <i>not </i>the \u201clowest-ever.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cKill me, I say,\u201d said Prof. Madhu Dandavate in 1996, chuckling. \u201cI just doubled poverty in your country today.\u201d What that fine old gentleman had really done, as deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission, was to jettison the bogus methodology peddled by that body before he came to head it the same year. Even minor changes in methodology or poverty line can produce dramatically differing estimates. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe fraud he undid was \u201can exercise\u201d bringing poverty down to 19 per cent in 1993-94. And that, from 25.5 per cent in 1987-88. These were the \u201cpreliminary results of a Planning Commission exercise based on National Sample Survey data\u201d (<i>Economic &amp; Political Weekly</i>, January 27, 1996). Now if these figures were true, then poverty has risen ever since. And remember, highlighting that historic fall was an honest Finance Minister. The never-tell-a-lie Dr. Manmohan Singh. One business daily ran a hilarious \u201cexclusive\u201d on this at the time. Poverty falls to record low of 19 per cent, \u201cgovernment officials say.\u201d This was the best news since Independence. But the modest officials remained anonymous, knowing how stupid they'd look. In the present era, they hold press conferences to flaunt their fraud. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe \u201clowest ever at 19 per cent\u201d fraud was buried in the ruins of the April 1996 polls. So was the government of the day. The \u201cestimate\u201d was not heard of again. Now we have the 29.9 per cent <i>avatar</i>. Surely that's a rise of 10.9 percentage points in 16 years? Or just another methodological fiddle. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, the new Planning Commission numbers have achieved one thing. They've united most of Parliament on the issue. Members from all parties have blasted the \u201cestimates\u201d and called for explanations. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere's also the Tendulkar report's own fiddles. As Dr. Madhura Swaminathan points out, the committee dumped the calorie norms of \u201c2,100 kcal per day for urban areas and 2,400 kcal for rural areas.\u201d It switched to \u201ca single norm of 1,800 kcal per day.\u201d And did so citing an \u201cFAO norm.\u201d As Dr. Swaminathan observed: \u201cthe standards set by the Food and Agriculture Organisation for energy requirements are for \u201c<i>minimum </i>dietary energy requirements\u201d or MDER. That is, \u201cthe amount of energy needed for light or sedentary activity.\u201d And she cites an FAO example of such activity. \u201c\u2026a male office worker in urban areas who only occasionally engages in physically demanding activities during or outside working hours.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAs Dr. Swaminathan asks: \u201cCan we assume that a head load worker who carries heavy sacks through the day is engaged in light activity?\u201d \u2014 <i>The Hindu</i>, February 5, 2010. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Measuring poverty</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe media rarely mention that there are other methodologies for measuring poverty on offer. Also set in motion by this same government. The National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS) saw BPL Indians as making up 77 per cent of the population. The N.C. Saxena-headed BPL Expert group placed it at around 50 per cent. Like the Tendulkar Committee, these two were also set up by government. While differing wildly, all three pegged rural poverty at a higher level than government did. Meanwhile, we will have many more committees on the same issue until one of them gives this government the report it wants. The one it can get away with. (The many inquiries on farm suicides exemplify this.) </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThat the Planning Commission thought they could slip the present bunkum by sets a new benchmark for \u2014 and marriage of \u2014 arrogance and incompetence. First, they sparked outrage with their affidavit in the Supreme Court. There they defended a BPL cut-off line of Rs.26 a day (rural) and Rs.32 (urban). Now they hope to get by with numbers of Rs.22.42 a day (rural) and Rs.28.35 a day (urban). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe same year the government and planning commission shot themselves in both feet in 1996, a leading Delhi think tank joined in. It came up with the \u201cbiggest ever study\u201d done on poverty in the country. This covered over 30,000 households and queried respondents across more than 300 parameters. So said its famous chief at a meeting in Bhopal. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis stunned the journalists in the audience. Till then, they had been doing what most journalists do at most seminars. Sleeping in a peaceful, non-confrontational manner. The veteran beside me came alive, startled. \u201cDid he mean they asked those households over 300 questions? My God! Thirty years in this line and the biggest interview I ever did had nine. That was with my boss's best friend. And my last question was \u2018may I go now'?\u201d We did suggest to the famous economist that battered with 300 questions, his respondents were more likely to die of fatigue than of poverty. A senior aide of the think tank chief took the mike to explain why we were wrong. We sent two investigators to each household, he said. Which made sense, of course: one to hold the respondent down physically, twisting his arm, while the other asked him 300 questions. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nNow to the queue of BPL, APL, IPL, <i>et al.</i>, may I add my own modest contribution? This is the CPL, or Corporate Plunder Line. This embraces the corporate world and other very well-off or \u201chigh net worth individuals.\u201d We have no money for a universal PDS. Or even for a shrunken food security bill. We've cut thousands of crores from net spending on rural employment. We lag horribly in human development indicators, hunger indexes and nutritional surveys. Food prices keep rising and decent jobs get fewer. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nYet, BPL numbers keep shrinking. The CPL numbers, however, keep expanding. The CPL concept is anchored in the \u201cStatement of Revenue Foregone\u201d section of successive union budgets. Since 2005-06, for instance, the union government has written off close to Rs.4 lakh crore in corporate income tax. Over Rs.50,000 crore of that in the present budget. The very one in which it slashes thousands of crores from the MNREGS. Throw in concessions on customs and excise duties and the corporate <i>karza maafi </i>in this year's budget sneaks up to nearly Rs.5 lakh crore. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nTrue, there are things covered in excise and customs that also affect larger sections, like fuel, for instance. But mostly, they benefit the corporate world and the very rich. In just this budget and the last one, we've written off Rs.1 lakh crore for diamonds, gold and jewellery in customs duties. That sort of money buys a lot of food security. But CPL trumps BPL every time. The same is true of write-offs on things like machinery. In theory, there's a lot that should benefit everybody: like the equipment hospitals import. In practice, most Indians will never enter the five-star hospitals that cash in on these benefits. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe total write-off on these three heads in eight years since 2005-06: Rs. 25.7 lakh crore. (<i>See Table</i>). That's over half a trillion U.S. dollars. Not far from 15 times the size of your 2G scam. Or over twice the Coal Scam, the latest addition to the CPL. Look at the table and think about BPL estimates working on cut-offs of Rs.22.42 a day rural and Rs.28.35 urban.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Advertising, Bollywood, Corporate power"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">That the terrible tragedy in Pune demands serious, sober coverage is a truism. One of the side-effects of the ghastly blast has been unintended, though. The orgy of self-congratulation that marked the media coverage of just about everything since January is now in pause mode. Maybe the flak they copped for their handling of the November 2008 Mumbai terror blasts has something to do with it. But there is, so far, some restraint. At least, relative to the meal they made of the 2008 blasts.</p> <p class=\"body\">Otherwise, through January and early February, the media stood up bravely for freedom of expression and some other constitutional rights you've never heard of. They slew the demons of lingual chauvinism and worse. And they're just spoiling for a fight with any other enemy of our proud democracy. Just so long as they can keep Bollywood in central focus.</p> <p class=\"body\">Every issue is now reduced to a fight between individuals, heroic, villainous or just fun figures. So the complex issues behind the shunning of Pakistani cricketers by the Indian Premier League are reduced to a fight between Shah Rukh Khan and Bal Thackeray. (As one television channel began its programme: \u201cShah Rukh stands tall. His message to the nation ...\u201d). The agonies of Bundelkhand are not about hunger and distress in our Tiger Economy. They are just a stand-off between Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati. The issues of language and migrations in Maharashtra are merely a battle between Rahul Gandhi and Uddhav Thackeray. And the coverage is all about who blinked first, who lost face.</p> <p class=\"body\">The devastating rise in food prices (let's skip the boring factors) and the mess in agriculture are a face-off between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar. The pathetic squabble within the Samajwadi Party is virtually a television serial. A blow-by-blow account of Amar Singh's valiant bid to retain his honour against Mulayam Singh's yahoos. (Indeed, some Hindi channels have begun using the language of theatre to report it \u2014 Act II, Scene II. And there was one programme which Mr. Amar Singh ended humming verses from his favourite film song). The Bt brinjal story had mostly only one villain \u2014 Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh. He had no visible adversary unless you pose the humble Brinjal as the hero. But that won't work for television. The other, more sinister heroes in this media story preferred to function from behind the scenes, plying newspapers and channels with faked data and false information. Hell hath no fury like a powerful corporate scorned, as the Minister is learning.</p> <p class=\"body\">Issues? The same media that passionately fought for freedom of expression for a month from mid-January had billed the 2009 Lok Sabha poll as one without issues. The country was actually burning with them, but they didn't make good television either. More accurately, the dominant media hadn't the slightest intention of covering them with any sincerity. The story of rising food prices remains one of the worst reported \u2014 no matter how much space it has been given. Sure, there have been exceptions \u2014 as in the case of some outstanding reports on Bundelkhand. But they've been just that. Exceptions.</p> <p class=\"body\">If these last six weeks have been about freedom of expression, we have neither. Or, at best, a twisted freedom and a tortured expression. There is little freedom for thousands of journalists in the corporate media and the few editors who still believe we ought to be doing a better job of informing the public on the key issues of our time. There's very little freedom for readers or viewers, too. For days on end, it didn't matter which television channel you switched to, it was SRK on all of them. When that movie drew to a close, the 'Rahul Gandhi storms Sena den' film was released and sustained. A visit of some hours produced days of footage. But with the end of Mr. Gandhi's visit to Mumbai, it was back to Shah Rukh Khan. Of course, viewers had the freedom to choose, which sets us apart from totalitarian states. They could choose any channel, from among many, to watch SRK saying exactly the same thing, at the same time. And they will be free to choose again when the figure is Amitabh Bachchan or Aamir Khan.</p> <p class=\"body\">If what we've watched on critical issues these past weeks is expression, we're through scraping the barrel. We're drilling holes in its bottom.</p> <p class=\"body\">Many corporate-owned media houses have sacked hundreds of journalists and non-journalist staff since late 2008. Hundreds of other journalists have suffered wage cuts. Of course, the \u2018right to know' of readers and viewers does not extend to this information. Why scare the poor lambs? And how can you tell them the truth about that while everyday crowing about the once-again booming economy? It might lead audiences to ask that dull, boring question: \u201cIf things are so good, why are you axing so many people?\u201d Answering that means revealing the interests the corporate media have in the fate of the stock market. It means talking about their need to keep the shares of the companies they are linked to (or have heavily invested in) afloat and buoyant. That is regardless of how rotten they are within. No matter how their own shares in those companies were obtained. And no agonising over how unethical the means used to keep them heated. This was in part behind the fatwa issued by some newspapers to their staff banning the \u2018R' word last year. Recession is what happens in the United States. In India, it was a slowdown \u2014 and it's already turning around brilliantly. The hundreds of sacked and ruined staff have little freedom to speak of. Even the professional communicators within them cannot tell their own audiences their story. Cannot tell them they were laid off, let alone tell them why.</p> <p class=\"body\">Leave aside escaping a recession, India Shining is back. The cover story of a leading weekly gushes over the fantastic \u2018rural resurgence' that is, in fact, saving all of us. Farmers are doing just great. Drip, micro-sprinkler, and other micro irrigation, the stories in it suggest, played a major role in this hidden-from-the-human-eye revival. This resurgence is seen more in urban media than in rural India. And the proliferation of such stories across the media spectrum reflects, in part, the strenuous media efforts of a major Maharashtra-based company. A corporate group that spends a fortune on propaganda and whose interests in this line of irrigation are pushed by some of the most powerful members of the Union Cabinet. Oddly, stories such as these come out even as the government's own projections for growth in agriculture are dismaying.</p> <p class=\"body\">The main \u2018rural resurgence' story hit the stands the same day the National Crime Records Bureau officially brought the 2008 data for farm suicides on to its website. The 16,196 suicides that year brought the tally of farmers' suicides since 1997 to 199,132. That's the largest single, sustained wave of such suicides ever recorded in history \u2014 anywhere. Guess nobody told them about the resurgence. Farmers in 2008 did know of that year's loan waiver, but it didn't stop large numbers of them from taking their lives.</p> <p class=\"body\">The \u2018rural resurgence' story comes after any number of the government's own committees, commissions and reports suggest that it revise poverty figures upwards. Whether it's the Suresh Tendulkar committee, the BPL Expert Group, or earlier the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised sector. Or a U.N. study which reports that 34 million more Indians remained poor or joined their ranks in 2008 and 2009, because of the \u2018slowdown.' That is, 34 million more than would have met that fate prior to the 2008 crisis. It matters little if Census data show us that 8 million cultivators quit agriculture between just 1991 and 2001. (That is, on average, well over 2,000 a day, every day for 10 years.) Or that the 2011 Census just months from now will show us how many more have fled agriculture since then, un-seduced by the rural resurgence. Never mind the facts. One giant private irrigation company stands to make its already huge fortune bigger. Good for growth.</p> <p class=\"body\">The ABC of Indian media roughly translates as Advertising, Bollywood and Corporate power. Some years ago, the \u2018C' would have been cricket, but that great sport is fast becoming a small cog in the large wheel of corporate profit. (In the IPL, the ABC of media converge, even merge.) And, of course, everything but everything, has to be bollywoodised. To now earn attention, issues have to be dressed up only in ways certified by the corporate media. They have to be justified not by their importance to the public but by their acceptability to the media, their owners and sponsors. The more entrenched that ABC gets, the greater the danger to the language of democracy the media so proudly claim to champion.</p>", "date": "February 18, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/advertising-bollywood-corporate-power/article108458.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Indian media", "Mumbai terror", "food prices", "Pakistani cricketers", "Indian Premier League", "Bundelkhand", "recession", "poverty figures", "rural resurgence", "Bollywood"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Nearly 2 lakh farm suicides since 1997"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">There were at least 16,196 farmers\u2019 suicides in India in 2008, bringing the total since 1997 to 199,132, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).</p> <p class=\"body\">The share of the Big 5 States or \u2018suicide belt\u2019 in 2008 \u2014 Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh \u2014 remained very high at 10,797, or 66.6 per cent of the total farm suicides in the country. This was marginally higher than it was in 2007 (66.2 per cent). Maharashtra remains the worst State in the nation for farm suicides with a total of 3802. (This is just 40 short of the combined total of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.) The all-India total of 16,196 represents a fall of 436 from 2007. But the broad trends of the past decade reflect no significant change. The national average for farm suicides since 2003 stays at roughly one every 30 minutes.</p> <p class=\"body\">Within the Big 5, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh recorded higher numbers. The increase of 604 in these three States somewhat offset the dip in Maharashtra (436) and Karnataka (398). But a fall in suicide numbers in other States (for example, a decline of 412 in Kerala and 343 in West Bengal) means that the Big 5 marginally increased their two-thirds share of total farm suicides in 2008.</p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB data now cover all States for 12 years from 1997. In the first six years (1997-2002), the Big 5 witnessed 55,769 farmers\u2019 suicides. From 2003 to 2008, they totalled 67,054, a rise of nearly 1900 a year on average.</p> <p class=\"body\">Maharashtra has logged 41,404 farm suicides from 1997 (over a fifth of the national total) and 44,468 from 1995, the year when this State began recording farm data. No other State comes close. During 1997-2002, Maharashtra saw, on average, eight farmers kill themselves daily. The corresponding figure rose to 11 during 2003-2008. The rise was from an average of 2,833 farm suicides a year in the first period to an average of 4,067 in the next period.</p> <p class=\"body\">Professor K. Nagaraj, an economist who has worked at the Madras Institute of Development Studies, says of the NCRB data: \u201cThere is hardly any decline in the suicide belt, though individual States may show variations across 12 years. If this is the state for 2008, the year of the Rs. 70,000 crore loan waiver and multiple farm packages, then 2009, a drought year, could show very disturbing figures. The underlying agrarian problems seem as acute as ever.\u201d</p>", "date": "January 22, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/nearly-2-lakh-farm-suicides-since-1997/article87699.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["farmer suicides", "National Crime Records Bureau", "suicide belt", "Maharashtra", "Andhra Pradesh", "Karnataka", "Madhya Pradesh", "Chhattisgarh"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["\u2018It is shameful to misguide people\u2019 "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nSo you thought you\u2019d had enough of Page 3? Newspapers in Maharashtra think otherwise. Some of them had more than one, on several days during the recent state elections. They even had supplements within supplements. So you had page 3 in the main paper. Then the main supplement with its own page 3. Then a further supplement within that, marked as Page III with Roman numerals (rarely, if ever, used in the Marathi press). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThis happened mostly during the last days before voting as desperate candidates poured in money to buy \u201cnews.\u201d As one senior journalist explained it: \u201cOn television, the number of bulletins shot up. In print, the number of pages. The demand had to be met. Often the extra package stuff came in at the last minute and had to be accommodated. Why turn them away?\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Marathi, Hindi, English, and Urdu newspapers across the State, you can find many fascinating things during the election period that were not turned away. Sometimes the same puff item appeared as \u2018news\u2019 in one newspaper and as an advertisement in another. \u201cIt is shameful to misguide people,\u201d reads the headline of an item paid for by Umakant (Babloo) Deotale, an independent candidate from Nagpur South West. This appears in Lokmat (Oct. 6) with a tiny \u2018ADVT\u2019 (advertisement) at the bottom. It appears the same day in The Hitavada (Nagpur\u2019s leading English language daily) with no mention at all of its being an advertisement. Mr. Deotale got one thing right: it is shameful to misguide people. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nInterestingly, a spate of genuine advertisements hit the pages on August 30. This was 24 hours before the election code of conduct \u2014 under which party and government expenditures come under scrutiny \u2014 came into force. After that, the word \u201cadvertisement\u201d disappeared, and with it even the fig leaf of \u201cresponse feature.\u201d The items became \u201cnews.\u201d There was a second surge of real ads just before candidates began filing nominations from September 18. This is because individual expenses come under scrutiny from the day the candidate files his or her nomination. Both these devices enabled the government, big parties, and rich candidates to spend huge sums of money that would not figure in poll expenditure accounts. Yet another device, widely used during the actual campaign, is absent in almost all candidate expenditure accounts: the massive use of SMS and voice mail messages. Also, the setting up of campaign-related websites. The amounts involved were significant. Their reflection in candidate accounts is nil. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cNews\u201d reports after August 30 and September 18 were fascinating in many ways. For one thing, there is not a single critical or negative line in any of them. Across hundreds of pages, the \u201cnews\u201d consists solely of how wonderful particular candidates were, their achievements, and the progress of their campaigns. Nothing about the issues. Their rivals, people of fewer resources, did not exist in these newspaper pages except, perhaps, as fall guys. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nFurther, if you struck the right deal, the same \u201cnews\u201d could appear in print, on television, and online. This was \u201cpackage journalism\u201d at its most advanced, that was truly multi-media. The shift to this kind of \u201cnews\u201d was so large that real advertising at election time \u2014 when it should have been highest \u2014 actually fell in some influential newspapers. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nSadly, a few senior journalists had their bylines on some of the paid stuff. Some of them had the rank of chief reporter or even chief of bureau. A few may have done so willingly. But there were those who told me: \u201cIn the days when this was about petty corruption of individual journalists, we had a choice. To be or not to be corrupt. Now when this is an organised industry run by our employers, what choice do we have?\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSeveral newspapers published in Maharashtra between October 1 and 10, 2009 make fun reading. Sometimes, you find a page of mysteriously fixed item sizes, say 125-150 words plus a double column photo. The \u201cfixed size\u201d items are curious. News seldom unfolds in such rigid terms. (Advertisements do.) Elsewhere, you can see multiple fonts and drop case styles in the same page of a single newspaper. This was so because everything \u2014 layouts, fonts, and printouts came from the candidate seeking a slot. Even the bad pictures sullying the pages of organised papers came from candidates. There was no way a daily with two or three photographers could cope with the frenzy and demand of the first ten days of October.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSometimes you got a more organised page or two \u2014 on which every single \u201cnews item\u201d was on one political party only. No one else was found newsworthy on those pages. Page 3 of Pudhari (Oct. 6) worked for the Congress this way. Pages 3 and 4 of Sakaal\u2019s Ranadhumali (\u201cTumult of the Battlefield\u201d) supplement (Oct. 10) found only MNS-related items relevant. Other major parties too, those with ample resources, got such treatment elsewhere. There were pages where only the NCP made \u201cnews\u201d ( Deshonnati Oct.11). Deshonnati\u2019s Sept. 15 edition had four pages on Chief Minister Ashok Chavan. Nothing else appeared in those pages. There were similarly 12 pages of Mr. Chavan in the Hindi daily Nav Bharat between Sept. 30 and Oct. 13 (which brings our tally of Chavan-centric full pages to 89). On the other hand, as D-day approached, you got crowded pages, some with as many as 12 items and 15 photographs. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nSince candidates or their political parties mostly delivered the \u201cnews\u201d in the poll-period, most papers did not edit or change a thing. How do we explain otherwise why the items and their \u201cbylines\u201d violate the papers\u2019 own style or practice? At the very least, this raises troubling questions. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nFor instance, Sakaal normally credits reports from its own staffers as \u201cBatmidar\u201d (reporter). Or else as being from Sakaal Vruttaseva (News Service) or from the Sakaal News Network. Or it uses the reporter\u2019s name in the story. But what are obviously Congress handouts (masquerading as news) come signed as \u201cPratinidhi\u201d (correspondent). So you found the newspaper carrying items marked \u201cPratinidhi\u201d against its own run of professional play. One of these party plugs signed \u201cPratinidhi\u201d ( Sakaal, Oct. 4) bears the headline \u201cState\u2019s leadership will return to Congress!\u201d Sakaal places \u201cBatmidar\u201d at the top of its stories, the Congress handouts place \u201cPratinidhi\u201d at the bottom. The two make odd bedfellows in the issues of October 4 and 9. Was this news? Was it advertising? Was it a bird or a plane? </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWell-known PR firms, professional designers, and ad agencies served the richer parties and candidates, making up their items in the standard fonts and sizes of the concerned newspapers. They also \u201ccustomised\u201d the \u201cnews\u201d to make it seem exclusive in different publications.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nA handful of candidates, many of them builders, made more \u201cnews\u201d than others. Conversely, smaller parties and less well-endowed candidates tended to get blacked out of any coverage in several newspapers across the State. Some of them have written to me, telling their stories. One, Shakil Ahmed, a lawyer and independent candidate in Sion-Koliwada in Mumbai, said the very newspapers that had earlier given him space as a social activist \u201cdemanded money to write about me as a candidate. Since I refused to pay, nobody wrote about me.\u201d Mr. Ahmed is eager to depose before the Election Commission of India as well as the Press Council of India.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nJournalists and activists from the districts sent us over a hundred issues of 21 different newspapers in the State. These ranged from high-circulation big names to small local dailies. All had their pages crowded with such \u201cnews.\u201d In television channels, the same items making the rounds sometimes arrived as news on one channel and as advertisements on another. One such item appeared on two channels with the voice of a reporter from a third. And with the boom mike of the third channel showing up on rival screens.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAs polling day approached, some journalists were besieged by desperate candidates with limited resources who risked being drowned in the flood. They needed professionals, they pleaded, to write their \u201cpaid news\u201d items and were willing to shell out the modest amounts they could afford. The last days of the campaign actually saw some of these tiny items \u2014reflecting the candidate\u2019s financial status \u2014 find their way on to newspapers pages. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAnd these were elections, the news media told us, that had \u201cno issues\u201d at all. </p>", "date": "December 23, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/it-is-shameful-to-misguide-people/article69681.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Maharashtra newspapers", "Lokmat", "The Hitavada", "Shakil Ahmed", "Sakaal News Network"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": [" And yet another pro-farmer budget"], "content": "<p class=\"body\"><i>The real heroes of India's success story were our farmers. Through their hard work, they ensured \u201cfood security\u201d for the country.</i><b>\u2014 Pranab Mukherjee, interim budget speech Feb. 16, 2009</b></p> <p class=\"body\"><i>This Budget belongs to 'Aam Aadmi'. It belongs to the farmer, the agriculturist, the entrepreneur and the investor</i>. <b>\u2014 Pranab Mukherjee, budget speech, Feb. 26, 2010</b></p> <p class=\"body\">Gee! Another pro-farmer budget. Going by the media, every budget this past decade has been one. Editorials across ten years have always found \u201ca new thrust\u201d to agriculture that spelt \u201cgood news\u201d for the farmer. Rarely mentioned are the massive subsidies, now larger than ever before, for the Corporate sector. This year alone, the budget gifts over Rs. 500,000 crore in write-offs, direct and indirect, to the Big Boys. That's Rs. 57 crore every single hour on average \u2014 almost a crore a minute. Beating last year's Rs. 30 crore an hour by more than 70 per cent. (See Tables 5 and 12 of the \u201cStatement of Revenue Foregone\u201d section of the budget.)</p> <p class=\"body\">Maybe the pro-farmer claim was merely a typo or proofing error. They just dropped the word \u201ccorporate\u201d before \u201cfarmer.\u201d Reinstate that and all is true. This is a budget crafted for, and perhaps by, the corporate farmer and agribusiness.</p> <p class=\"body\">Some television Channels set the tone for the debate before the budget in giant hoardings: Will Pranab Mukherjee function \u201clike the CEO of India Inc., or will he behave like a politician?\u201d The message was straight: the finance minister's job is to serve India Inc. not the people of India. A second ad in this series read: \u201cWill FM's speech DESTROY or CREATE Market Wealth?\u201d In the event, the Finance Minister more than lived up to their demands. The budget hands out new bonanzas for Corporate Kleptocrats. It goes further than earlier ones in pushing the private sector as prime driver of development and economy. Not the public sector.</p> <p class=\"body\">Take Mr. Mukherjee's \u201cfour-pronged strategy\u201d for agriculture. The first of these, \u201cagricultural production,\u201d could mean anything. The other three are a goldmine for large corporations, not the countless millions of small and marginal farmers who produce India's food. Take \u201cReduction in wastage of produce.\u201d This means more big bucks for companies setting up storage facilities. Take this together with the related \u201cCredit Support to farmers.\u201d Already, an Ambani or a Godrej can set up a cold storage in Mumbai and get agricultural rates of credit for it. That's thanks to our re-jigging of what \u201cagricultural credit\u201d and \u201cpriority sector lending\u201d mean. This budget takes that process further.</p> <p class=\"body\">More and more of \u201cagricultural\u201d credit will go not to farmers but corporations. Indeed, \u201ceven External Commercial Borrowings will henceforth be available for cold storage or cold room facility.\u201d The budget even says: \u201cChanges in the definition of infrastructure under the ECB policy are being made\u201d to foster this process. Some of those changes have already happened. Several of the loans disbursed as \u201cagricultural credit\u201d are in excess of Rs. 10 crore and even Rs. 25 crore. And even as loans of this size steadily grew in number between 2000 and 2006, agricultural loans of less than Rs. 25,000 fell by more than half in the same period. (See Revival of Agricultural Credit in the 2000s: An Explanation. R. Ramakumar and Pallavi Chavan, <i>EPW</i> December 29, 2007.)</p> <p class=\"body\">Met any subsistence farmers taking out Rs. 25 crore loans lately? Nor will it be small or marginal farmers availing of the \u201cfull exemption from customs duty to refrigeration units required for the manufacture of refrigerated vans or trucks.\u201d Nor is the \u201cinfusion of technology\u201d proclaimed going to help them.</p> <p class=\"body\">The budget promises \u201cappropriate banking facilities\u201d in every village with a population of over 2000. Since 1993, the number of rural branches of scheduled commercial banks has steadily fallen, even as the rural population has grown. So taken together with the licenses to be given out to private operators, this means the new branches will be those of private banks. Not one of whom has an iota of interest in small and marginal farmers. Nor are they bound by the social banking obligations that once guided the nationalised sector. \u201cA thrust to the food processing sector\u201d is exactly the same. More cash for big companies. You know who the \u201cstate-of-the-art infrastructure\u201d will be built for \u2014 with public money.</p> <p class=\"body\">Of the many claims the media have dished out for weeks now, none is more absurd than the fiction that farmers have gained massively from soaring food prices. And that rural India is doing so well, its saving the rest of us. (And doing that on a projected growth of minus 0.2 per cent).</p> <p class=\"body\">Higher MSPs certainly helped ease pressure. So have higher global prices for some products in a few cases - briefly. But with higher food prices, with retail prices rising many times faster than wholesale, where does the farmer begin to benefit? Farm gate prices are way below those of even the wholesale markets. Further, over 70 per cent of Indian farmers are net purchasers of foodgrain. (Between 55 per cent and 60 per cent of the average Indian farm household's monthly per capita expenditure goes on food.) Huge rises in food prices crush them. Remember the excuse trotted out for letting Big Retail sell agricultural produce? It would do away with the \u201cmiddleman,\u201d giving farmers and consumers a better deal. Yet prices of fresh produce are costlier at big retail's outlets. You still get a better deal from the petty vendor on the street. Often, that pathetic \u201cmiddleman\u201d they're crushing is a poor woman street vendor. The last and weakest link in the chain of intermediaries between farmer and public. The new middlemen wear suits.</p> <p class=\"body\">The \u2018higher-prices-benefit-farmers' mob seems clueless about what has happened with cultivation costs. It took Rs. 2,500, for instance, to cultivate an acre of cotton in Vidarbha in 1991. Rs. 13,500 in 2006-07 and Rs. 18,000 to Rs. 20,000 today. (Counting family labour and like costs). The 'gains' from these higher costs are cornered by the corporate world in sectors like seed, fertiliser and pesticide. Soaring input costs have been crucial to farm bankruptcies, debt and suicides. The looming cuts in fertiliser subsidies won't spark rural euphoria either.</p> <p class=\"body\">An incentive to repay loans on time \u2014 which millions of farmers cannot do \u2014 is being passed off as an additional subsidy to the aam kisan in this budget. And there is still an air of self-congratulation on the Rs. 70,000-crore farm loan waiver of 2008. A one-off waiver that comes once in so many decades. Yet revenue foregone in this budget in direct tax concessions to corporate tax payers is close to Rs. 80,000 crores. It was over Rs. 66,000 crore last year. And Rs. 62,000 crore the year before that. In all, Rs. 2,08,000 crores of direct freebies in 36 months.</p> <p class=\"body\">Consider that this loot-and-grab sortie has been on for two decades now. It means that in direct tax freebies alone the corporate sector has had the equivalent of some 15 'farm loan waivers' since 1991. Then there's the indirect stuff. In this year's budget: Revenue foregone in excise duty \u2014 Rs. 1,70,765 crores. Customs duty \u2014 Rs.2,49,021 crores. Together with the Rs.80,000 crore in direct write-offs, the total nears Rs. 500,000 crores.</p> <p class=\"body\">The media's shameless lobbying for Corporate \u201cwishlists\u201d began weeks before the budget. A class and vested interest analysis of the writers, panels, discussants, \u201cexperts\u201d (and anchors) would be edifying. Budget time is when Big media are seen for what they are: stenographers to the powerful.</p> <p class=\"body\">Ill-informed aam aadmi rants in the streets are quickly 'balanced' by \u2018the experts.' Sure, there is, in a few panels, the odd dissenter. This discussant the anchor always turns to with a wry smile of amused tolerance. The unstated message to viewers: \u201chere's this whacko with his loony left delusions. Accept him as the comic relief in what are otherwise serious discussions.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Never mind that some of these deluded dissenters warned \u2014 correctly \u2014 of the type of crisis that shook the world in 2008. Not one of the \u201cexperts\u201d ever came within miles of predicting that meltdown. They were in fact proclaiming the Golden Age to be upon us when their babble hit the fan. But no questions on their competence. Many of the \u201cexperts\u201d have direct ties to large corporations and peddle their interests with zest. Sometimes, with a little more sophistication than panting media hucksters who show not a trace of the scepticism their profession demands of them. Straining at the leash to beat their rivals in serving the richest 1 per cent (or less) of Indians.</p> <p class=\"body\">Mr. Mukherjee's budget speech spouts dated World Bank babble about the \u201cthe focus of economic activity\u201d shifting \u201ctowards the non-governmental actors.\u201d And about \u201cthe role of Government as an enabler.\u201d (Private corporations and football clubs also qualify as non-governmental actors, but never mind). \u201cAn enabling Government does not try to deliver directly to the citizens everything that they need. Instead it creates an enabling ethos...\u201d His budget does that. It enables a grasping corporate world to grab more public wealth. And the entrenchment of perhaps of the most parasitic elite in the planet.</p>", "date": "March 1, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/and-yet-another-profarmer-budget/article123884.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["budget", "agriculture", "media", "corporates"]}

A sympathetic village has adopted the young creature, who seems at ease with his new world. Other wildlife has been less fortunate. Boar, deer and even peacocks coming out of the forest or woods for water have been eaten by hungry villagers. The desperate search for water is a matter of life and, literally, death.</p> <p class=\"body\">Across rural Amravati, Akola, Washim and Yavatmal, almost every human being you see between 6 and 10 a.m. in the morning (and often at other hours, too) is collecting or searching for water. If they're women or even tiny girls, they're carrying vessels, empty or full, on their heads. If men, they're riding some sort of cart or bicycle trying to collect as much water as they can find. This sometimes means fiddling with the valves of pipelines or just marauding any well they can. Wells that still have some water, that is. One group talks to us while emptying such a well. \u201cLook at this water,\u201d says one of them smiling, showing us a brownish liquid in his battered can. Meanwhile, some of Vidarbha's reservoirs are approaching or have arrived at dead storage levels. That is, at levels from which the water cannot be lifted or transported.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cIn some of our villages,\u201d says Vasudev Ingle in Kinkhed in Akola district, \u201cyou can get water through the formal supply once in 10 or 12 days.\u201d Maya Ove of Dharel village, carrying three pots on her head, each atop the other, stops to agree. \u201cThis takes hours of our time every day.\u201d Even the livestock you see are searching for water. And wild animals are wandering into the farms or villages looking for it.</p> <p class=\"body\">Vidarbha is not a very low rainfall region. Some of its districts get 900 mm or more a year on average. But the last two years have been bad. Rainfall has either been very deficient or highly erratic in timing and intensity. The drought of mid-2009 really took its toll on people from February and March this year. Had the 2009 crop not failed in the drought, the income from that would have come in fully in February and March. In single crop areas, which most of this region really is, crop failure means up to 24 months without income. Two successive failures could mean up to 34 months that way. A third is too awful to contemplate in a region already beset by crisis, farm suicides and man-made calamity.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThe water position is very serious,\u201d says Amravati Divisional Commissioner Dinesh Waghmere. Five of Vidarbha's six \u2018crisis' districts fall in this division which has had 3,465 of its villages declared as scarcity-hit. \u201cMost reservoirs are running at levels of 8-10 per cent or even much less. In Yavatmal, there are some at dead storage level.\u201d At that stage, it serves only to keep the fish alive. In Pentakli in Buldhana district, for instance, the level is 0.98 per cent. In Arunavati in Yavatmal, it's at 3.21 per cent. In Bembla in the same district, it is almost dry.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Groundwater crisis</b></p> <p class=\"body\">The groundwater crisis is no less acute. Over extraction, misuse and illegal \u201cwater mining\u201d have combined with other factors to push the water table ever lower. In some talukas, says a geologist with the Groundwater Survey and Development Authority (GSDA), the depletion has been three metres in five years and eight since 2000. Lack of rain does not help an already poor recharge. Meteorological drought has combined with its hydrological counterpart to sharpen the problem. \u201cFor years, strengthening water sources and helping improve recharge \u2014 these vital things were never taken up in this region,\u201d says a senior official. \u201cNow we're paying the price.\u201d And the effects of water-related projects under both Prime Minister's and Chief Minister's packages, if any, are invisible.</p> <p class=\"body\">The heat is on, quite literally. Afternoon temperatures cross 45\u00b0C or worse. That 8 to 10 hour power cuts end up crossing 14 hours \u201cunofficially\u201d, does little to improve tempers.</p> <p class=\"body\">Administrators locally have stepped up the number of tankers carrying water to villagers. Yavatmal has over 200 functioning, Buldhana 61, Washim 55 and so on. The local administrations have also been requisitioning private wells for Rs.300 a day on average and supplying water from there to a desperate people. \u201cEven those are running out,\u201d says one official. We can add more tankers, but where's the water?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Some are counting the days to June 15 by which time they hope the rains arrive. Yavatmal Collector Sanjay Deshmukh is going to release water from what remains in a few days from now. \u201cWhat's the point of holding on to it with people in such need of it?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe amount there is, we will lose it anyway to evaporation. It's at such levels. Better people get to drink it than watch it dry up.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile Qureshi, who has watched it dry up, is seeking renewal of his licence to operate in Panderkauda town. \u201cI'm done with my old circuit,\u201d he says. \u201cThe villages are no place to sell meat.\u201d</p>", "date": "April 29, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-colour-of-water/article414088.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["water scarcity", "drought", "Vidarbha"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Our drought came before yours"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nThikkaswamy\u2019s business is missing out on the recovery. It never gained from any stimulus package either. \u201cI\u2019m sunk,\u201d he told us. Thikkaswamy is a pasukapari \u2014 a professional cowherd or caretaker, who looks after livestock entrusted to him by the villagers of Harekal in Andhra\u2019s Kurnool district. \u201cI was tending about 250 head of cattle,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople paid me, on average about Rs. 60 a month per cow to look after their animals.\u201d On this Rs. 2 a day per animal, Thikkaswamy grazed, cleaned up and cared for the cows and buffaloes. \u201cThat brought in Rs. 15,000 a month, roughly.\u201d With so many animals, he hired four men whom he paid Rs. 100 a day each. Leaving him, too, with about Rs. 3,000 a month plus a few fringe benefits by way of a little milk, manure, and the like.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThen came the price rise. People began withdrawing their cattle from the herd to save on the Rs. 60. With prices of almost everything rising, including fodder, Thikkaswamy\u2019s earnings eroded. Monsoon failure struck next, sharpening fodder scarcity. A tractor load now costs around Rs. 11-12,000, ten times what it was some months ago. Then as both water and fodder disappeared, people began selling their cattle in distress. The pasukapari\u2019s herd shrank to around 150. He could no longer pay his workers. \u201cI am losing money every day,\u201d he complains.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo Thikkaswamy sacked his four assistants and replaced them with young boys who could be paid half, or just Rs. 50 a day. \u201cBut fodder prices keep rising and where\u2019s the water? I cannot sustain this much longer.\u201d His is a tiny enterprise. But there are countless thousands of Thikkaswamys (and their assistants) in India\u2019s villages, which are also home to some 600 million farm animals. Across Andhra Pradesh, in this water-starved period, myriad other little businesses too, have gone bust. If the state has averted great disaster, it is because a strong NREGs and rice at Rs. 2 a kilo have worked well to provide lifejackets.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe little businesses, though, have suffered anyway. In Palacherla village in Anantapur district\u2019s Rapthadu mandal, Narayanamma fears her \u201cChicken Centre\u201d won\u2019t survive. \u201cChicken has gone up from Rs. 60 to over Rs. 100 a kilo,\u201d she says glumly. So her weekly sales have fallen from 70 to less than 30 kg. \u201cBesides, all items were getting costlier even before the drought. We eat less of everything at home. What to do if kandi pappu (tur dal) costs Rs. 100 a kilo?\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThat price rise has hit the mid-day meals at schools and squeezed the SHGs that provide them at Rs. 3 per schoolchild each day. At the High School in A. Gokulapadu village of Kurnool, the SHG women say \u201cWe were getting 5-6 quintals of rice a month. Now just 2 or 3.\u201d Which means servings are smaller. And the high cost of kandi pappu means the sambhar has become more watery. Any margin this SHG made on its service has vanished.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe diminutive shops that dot the villages all the way from Anantapur and Kurnool districts in Rayalaseema to Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda in Telangana, report huge falls in turnover. \u201cWhatever people earn goes on food and even that they buy much less,\u201d says Sujathamma. At her little store, a rickety cabin in Bundipally village of Mahbubnagar district, daily turnover \u201chas fallen from Rs. 1000 to around Rs. 200.\u201d B. Anjaneyulu, a borewell repairer, has \u201cnot been called in to repair a single one in three months.\u201d His neighbour Jangalamma\u2019s \u201chotel,\u201d (a very small dhaba really), \u201cused to have a turnover of Rs. 1,200 a day. Now down to Rs. 300.\u201d Along the road, we run into a travelling peddler and his wife selling metal utensils by weight. \u201cWe used to sell around seven or eight kilos at Rs. 20 a kilo. We\u2019re down to about four kilos a day.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Marlabeedu, Sreenivasalu Rao, a milk buyer collects \u201cless than 100 litres a day in this village where it should be 300. Many of my clients have sold their cattle in distress.\u201d One of those is M. Ramanna. \u201cHe used to sell me several litres a day. Now he buys milk from me.\u201d Ramanna smiles: \u201cI had to sell all my cows, that\u2019s why.\u201d He buys half a litre and walks off.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe rural towns show a similar pattern. In Kadiri town of Anantapur, those running the biggest \u201ccotton cut-piece store,\u201d say \u201cwe should have seen a daily turnover of more than Rs. 20,000 in this season. Now it\u2019s under Rs.7,000 a day. Last year this time, we would not have had the time to talk to you.\u201d (Families traditionally buy new clothes at the time of the Ganesh festival.) But now \u201cI fear a day when we won\u2019t open the cash box even once.\u201d Nearby, the Satya Sai General Store owner P.S. Vishnu says: \u201cprice rise hit people before the drought did. They just stopped buying. \u2018fancy items\u2019 like costumes, soaps, powder, shampoo \u2014 they\u2019re not selling at all. Our turnover has fallen by half. My seven employees were on their toes last year. Look at them now, no work to do.\u201d And even the wine store \u2014 Sri Lakshmi Venkateswara Wines \u2014 says its turnover has collapsed \u201cfrom between Rs. 80,000 to Rs. 1 lakh a day to around Rs. 40,000 a day.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOne sector, though, is doing well. Salesmen at what is perhaps Kadiri\u2019s biggest pharmacy say \u201clast month, we were selling goods worth Rs. 14,000 a day. Now that\u2019s Rs. 19,000.\u201d And the highest selling items: \u201cCardiac and BP related medicines.\u201d Other pharmacies are not losing any money, either. \u201cMaybe,\u201d says one activist, \u201chealth is wealth after all.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn Kodumuru town in Kurnool, M. Krishnamurthy speaking for the devastated community of weavers says: \u201cDrought? Our drought came before your drought. Weavers have been suffering for years with no sales, no bank loans, captured by dalals. Our drought is more than a drought of rain. The latter only made things worse.\u201d\n</p>", "date": "August 27, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/our-drought-came-before-yours/article10427.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["drought", "farmers", "Thikkaswamy", "cowherd", "Harekal"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Thirty-four months with no income"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a people whose next income \u2014 if they\u2019re lucky \u2014 will materialise in January or February 2011,\u201d says Y.V. Malla Reddy in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. He is a 35-year veteran of NGO activism in this district, which till last week had seen perhaps the worst rainfall of the season anywhere in the country. The \u201cnext income\u201d is always a fragile process in this single-crop district heavily focussed on groundnut, but 16 months away?</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThe kharif is gone,\u201d say farmers in village after village. He adds: \u201cThe late rains will help us with some fodder and maybe we can sow a few short-duration crops. But the groundnut [the main crop] is gone.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Had the kharif been all right, says Mr. Malla Reddy, \u201cthey would have harvested it in November and December. It would have been sold in January-February 2010, five months from now. With that gone, the next sowing will be in July 2010. If that crop succeeds \u2014 it is always an \u2018if\u2019 over here \u2014 they will harvest it four months later and earn from it only when they sell in January-February 2011.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Mr. Reddy, who heads the Ecology Centre, Anantapur, also points out: \u201cIt\u2019s not 16 months without an income, it\u2019s 34. Last year, excess rains wrecked the groundnut crop; so many [farmers] drew a blank in January-February 2009. Which means their last income came in 2008 February. The next is due in January 2011.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">How, then, are people surviving at all right now? \u201cOf the 175 families here,\u201d says P. Challaiah, a farmer in Palavai village, \u201call but half a dozen are sending members to NREGS sites. In fact, 200 people go from this village for that. Take that away and we\u2019re dead.\u201d Migration has plummeted in this village which once saw a hundred people moving out in search of work each year. \u201cBut,\u201d says farmer and activist Maruti, \u201cwe wish they\u2019d run the programme for at least 200 days a year. If there\u2019re three of us in a family, those \u2018100 days\u2019 are gone in 30.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">These feelings are echoed in Palacherla village of the same Rapthadu mandal. It has 350 families \u2014 and 400 people reporting for work at the NREGS sites. Here, too, migrations have fallen sharply in the past two years. \u201cEven [rain-fed] farmers owning 20-25 acres are seeking NREGS work,\u201d laughs Prakash Reddy, a farmer here. \u201cWe need it. Not only because of the higher wage. The landowners might pay the same as they have to compete with it. But how many days will they give \u2014 five or ten, at this time?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">It is the same picture across the Rayalaseema and Telangana regions. The poor in Andhra Pradesh have three things going for them: The NREGS, rice at Rs.2 a kg and pensions for the aged and women. At this point, the dependence on <i>nooru rojula panni</i> (hundred days\u2019 work), as the NREGS is known here, is total.</p> <p class=\"body\">In Anantapur, where it has performed robustly, Collector B. Janardhan Reddy and Project Director P. Murali confirm the explosion in demand. There were roughly 97,000 wage-seekers in July 2008. This July that number was over 2,20,000, an increase of over 126 per cent. In August last year, wage-seekers totalled 57,000 for that month. This year, in just the first 15 days of August, they numbered 1,46,000. That is an increase of over 156 per cent \u2014 with just half the month counted.</p> <p class=\"body\">For the poor and landless it is clearly the lifeline. But many little (and sometimes not so little) shop owners in Anantapur, Kurnool and Mahbubnagar have also sought work in the NREGS. In the arid zones, rain-fed farmers with up to 30 acres have reported for work. In Nalgonda district, skilled stone-cutters, facing the collapse of their trade, are eager to come use it. The drought comes atop a crippling price rise and the \u201ceconomic slowdown.\u201d A time when many have suffered great loss of income.</p> <p class=\"body\">So much so that Ganesh pandals across these districts look forlorn. \u201cThere\u2019s no <i>chanda</i> [contributions] this year,\u201d say people in Pothireddypally in Mahbubnagar. In Nalgonda, the political parties have stepped in \u2014 competitively \u2014 to put up the pandals as ordinary folk are broke. \u201cWe have a Congress Ganesh, a TDP one, a PRP rival, a TRS contender and even a Communist Ganesh,\u201d laughs a local activist.</p> <p class=\"body\">Why does Anantapur have this prolonged no-income cycle? Isn\u2019t any other crop possible? Why think of short-duration crops only when groundnut sinks? \u201cThere has never really been a rabi crop in Anantapur where over two-thirds of the cultivable area is under shallow, gravel-like red soil.\u201d says Mr. Malla Reddy. \u201cJust 10 per cent of the cultivated area is black cotton soil. And a second crop on this has been rare to non-existent.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">This is also a district where irrigation actually declined from a peak of 17 per cent in the late 1980s to just about 11 per cent by the middle of this decade. \u201cBesides,\u201d says Mr. Malla Reddy, \u201cthe rainy season is between June and October. To attempt another crop you must sow by September. But the groundnut crop cycle lasts 110-115 days, all the way into October. Harvesting begins in November if you\u2019ve sown in July. So the best you can do is to have a contingency crop when groundnut cannot be sown. The question of a regular second crop does not arise on 90 per cent of the land.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">There is a brief lull in Anantapur\u2019s NREGS activity as late rains have arrived and farmers are scrambling to sow something. \u201cYou said the late rains will give a very limited yield, if any at all,\u201d I ask. \u201cThen why are you sowing now, especially groundnut, which will not succeed at this point?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">There are sheepish grins all around. Last year\u2019s groundnut crop in Anantapur, destroyed by excess rain, was covered by nearly Rs.600-crore worth of insurance. The varying amounts they get from this will be their only, if limited, cushion for now.</p> <p class=\"body\">For a people with no income from crops to speak of for 34 months (and with a limited number of days in the NREGS) this is a straw to clutch at. In effect, they are sowing a crop called Insurance 2009. In a terrible period, it just might give them some respite. At least until \u2014 and if \u2014 the kharif of 2010 brings them an income in January 2011.</p>", "date": "September 1, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/thirtyfour-months-with-no-income/article12859.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["farmers", "Andhra Pradesh", "income", "NREGs", "Anantapur", "kharif", "Palacherla", "rains", "the poor", "Kurnool", "Mahbubnagar"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["NREGS: not caste in stone "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Balijas, Reddys and other upper or dominant castes working on improving the lands of Dalits? It\u2019s happening here in Kondama Naiyuni Palayam village of Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh. Call it necessity. Call it NREGS. The heavy late rains may have brought relief to Rayalaseema region in terms of fodder, and drinking water. But they also devastate the short duration crops that people have sown. So this village and its neighbours are heavily NREG dependent.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWe work together, all of us, and not on a caste basis,\u201d say E. Ravi and K. Maheshwar, both Balijas. NREGS work priorities are clear here. The land development programme under it must first exhaust dalit and adivasi households before serving the others. In places like K.N. Palayam, where the villagers are organised, this actually gets done. It is not the same everywhere. And it would be rash to conclude that the NREGS is breaking down social hierarchies big time. It is certainly calling them into question, though.</p> <p class=\"body\">There is also economic necessity. \u201cEven people with 25 acres in our rainfed farms seek NREGS work, says Narasimha Reddy in Palacherla village. Yes, he confirms, most landowning Reddy households in this village of 350 families are reporting for NREG work \u2014 a big shift in attitudes. About 400 people \u2014 an equal number of men and women \u2014 go to the NREG site.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Impact on social structures</b></p> <p class=\"body\">Within limits, says Malla Reddy, a 35-year veteran of NGO activism here, the NREGS does impact on social structures. Now, when landowners call Dalits or Adivasis to work, they are relatively more respectful. Because the labourers have the option of Rs. 100 a day work here.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In K.N. Palayam, groups like the Rural and Environment Development Society have sharpened that impact. REDS has managed a creative interpretation of NREG rules locally. \u201cYou\u2019ll find several households that have exceeded 100 days work,\u201d says C. Bhanuja, President of REDS. We did.</p> <p class=\"body\">It isn\u2019t all quite simple, however. Both, the programmes\u2019 own problems and those within the economy and society surface often. A full fifth of those seeking work in K.N. Palayam are over 60 years of age. S. Kadhar Wali, who is well over 70, puts it simply: \u201cWhy work at 70? You may as well ask, why eat at 70.\u201d He and his wife S. Bibi have been doing NREGS work from 2006. This year, Bibi dropped out after a bout of typhoid. \u201cWe returned to work as the rise in food prices has destroyed poor people these past few years.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In Aiyaram Gopalapadu, Kurnool, ex-Sarpanch C. Sankaraiah, clings to the old hierarchies. \u201cI won\u2019t do it,\u201d he says, dismissing NREG work. \u201cI own nine acres. It\u2019s insulting.\u201d But what about those 30-acre rainfed farmers in Anantapur, spotted at NREG sites? \u201cAnantapur politics are very different from our politics here.\u201d But one of his sons is working at the very site he leads us to.</p> <p class=\"body\">Contradictions do plague the NREGS in its present avatar. One, between landowners and landless labourers. \u201cThis Rs. 100 a day wage is killing us,\u201d grumble many of the bigger landowners. Actually, most workers average Rs. 80. But the bigger owners are hostile. And then there are the small and medium land holders. They employ wage labour \u2014 but also work at NREG sites themselves to make ends meet. \u201cThis wage is hurting our farming operations and driving the price rise,\u201d goes the chorus in Palavai, Palacherla and elsewhere. </p> <p class=\"body\">The same voices protest when asked what they would do if the NREG wage fell to Rs. 50 tomorrow. \u201cHow will we survive? We need this wage.\u201d These are people owning between 5 and 8 acres. </p> <p class=\"body\">The late rains stoke the farmer-labourer contradiction. The farmers want NREGS put on hold so they can attend to their fields and find labour for them. The landless cannot afford to go without work for any length of time. That\u2019s when migrations surface again, though overall, the programme has reduced them considerably. That\u2019s the case in K. Nagalapuram in Kurnool, where we run into many labourers leaving for Bangalore. Another universal complaint is about payment delays. \u201cThese are killing,\u201d says Somappa as he departs for Bangalore. </p> <p class=\"body\">There is also the odd village where the NREG has been captured by local mafias determined to keep the wages down. As In Harekal in Kurnool district where NREGS work vanished for months. (However work resumed the next day following a report in Eenadu after our visit.) Or in Pothireddypalli in Mahbubnagar, where the priority for work on Dalit lands is being subverted. Tractor owners evade land development work on Dalit farms. \u201cOur bills will never be settled,\u201d claims one of them. In Anantapur, the Lambada adivasis of Kareddypalli tanda are bogged down by bureaucratic quibbles and local tensions. \u201cOur tanda is in Kadiri Mandal [rural],\u201d points out T. Nagesh. \u201cBut our fields are just yards away in the next, Nallacheruvu mandal. The people there won\u2019t let us work and the officials do nothing.\u201d And so several in the tanda have migrated \u2014 to Kerala. </p> <p class=\"body\">And there is the work itself. The broad success of NREGS in states like Andhra has seen some romanticise it. You only have to attempt the body-sapping work that a hungry malnourished people do, in sizzling temperatures, to swiftly abandon such ideas. Hearing of NREG \u201cboycotts\u201d in villages like Sanevaripalli in Anantapur, we went there. \u201cWhat boycott?\u201d asks Nagappa, who owns five acres here. \u201cThey give us impossible work. See this rocky land. Don\u2019t tell us about trenching and digging, just try it yourself in this hard and dry soil. And what will it achieve? Why can\u2019t they give us sensible work which we can do.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Not insurmountable</b></p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThese are not insurmountable problems,\u201d says Malla Reddy. \u201cThe people of this village themselves are showing us alternatives within the NREGS.\u201d They show us large tracts of land that can be made cultivable removing the small but heavy rocks that dot them. \u201cThen there is the development of common lands with vegetation and fodder. Farm ponds could also prove crucial. You have to be imaginative and use diverse approaches across regions. In Anantapur for instance, we have forests without trees. The regeneration of those could be a major work. In zones like these, rain-fed horticulture development would help. And in fact, we should be creating work for landless and small farmers round the year. We need very strict enforcement of priorities that demand Dalit and Adivasi lands be the first to benefit. Finally, it means dumping the 100-day per household yearly limit on work. All this can only happen when you move from piecemeal action to integrated, long-term planning.\u201d</p>", "date": "September 14, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/nregs-not-caste-in-stone/article19803.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["NREGS", "P.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The lurch of the Lemmings"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nOne of the most enduring of media-created myths is that of mass suicide amongst Lemmings, the little rodents that live mostly in and around the Arctic. A 1958 Disney documentary film staged scenes of large numbers of Lemmings marching mindlessly off a cliff to their doom in the waters below. Actually, Lemmings can swim. The rodents see major migrations when they multiply rapidly and their population grows. And when this dispersal finds big numbers crossing large bodies of water, some of them drown by accident, not by intent. However, the Disney film \u2014 where they were actually <i>forced off a cliff</i> \u2014 and earlier articles, created a false notion that still holds: that Lemmings commit mass suicide by leaping off cliffs and drowning in the waters below. This is also the origin of the political slang: \u2018Lemming-like behaviour,' to describe a suicidal course of action.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nPolitical scientists in India 2011 can now be forgiven a rethink on the whole fraud. You begin to wonder if there was some truth in it, after all. The ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) seems determined to prove that this instinct of the little creatures was no myth. The race off the cliff is real, with Congress Lemmings leading the charge of the light-footed brigade. The massive hike in petrol prices at a time of raging food inflation was merely one among such efforts. In just seven months, the price of petrol has gone up by over Rs. 10. The new hike came even as the government announced that it was taking the price rise seriously and has formed yet more panels and Groups of Ministers to study the problem.( Another Group of Ministers was to have met in December 2010 to decide on whether to hike diesel and LPG prices as well. Yet another was to take a call on raising APL foodgrain prices.) Lemmings, after all, mostly act in large groups.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNow that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has rearranged the deck chairs on the Titanic, the impression of a collective rush to mass drowning only grows. Handing the rural development portfolio to a man just trashed by the Supreme Court for protecting moneylenders in Vidharbha while he was Chief Minister of Maharashtra, has a Kamikaze-like courage about it. Not only did the Court admonish Vilasrao Deshmukh in scathing terms, it also enhanced the fine levied by the Bombay High Court's Nagpur bench on the government of Maharashtra in the same case from Rs.25,000 to Rs.10 lakh. Now in normal and non-Lemming circles, this would have led to his unaccompanied exit off the Cabinet Cliff.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nJustice A. K. Ganguly in his judgment on the case involving Mr. Deshmukh says, among other things: \u201cThe message conveyed in this case is extremely shocking and it shocks the conscience of this Court about the manner in which the Constitutional functionaries behaved in the State of Maharashtra.\u201d The judgment goes on to say \u201cit is clear that the Chief Minister was aware of various complaints being filed against the said family [the moneylenders: PS]. Even then he passed an order for a special treatment in favour of the said family which is unknown to law.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe judgment notes the debt-induced plight of farmers in that very region and also says of Mr. Deshmukh's action: \u201cThis amounts to bestowing special favour to some chosen few at the cost of the vast number of poor people who as farmers have taken loans and who have come to the authorities of law and order to register their complaints against torture and atrocities by the moneylenders.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nObviously, in Dr. Singh's view, the perfect candidate to preside over the destiny of rural India and its development. A man during whose eight years as Chief Minister of Maharashtra, well over 30,000 farmers took their own lives in the State \u2014 a feat unrivalled anywhere in the country. Mr. Deshmukh's most famous remark on the farmers: \u201cCommitting suicide is an offence under the Indian Penal Code. But did we book any farmer for this offence? Have you reported that?\u201d (<i>The Hindustan Times</i>, October 31, 2007). Just after the terror attacks of 26/11, he went to the Taj hotel, with his actor son and Bollywood filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma in tow. This provoked outrage in a public which saw them as disaster tourists checking out the rich cinematic promise thrown up by the tragic events. Sacked from his post, Mr. Deshmukh spent some months in cold storage before being elevated to the Union Cabinet.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nHis successor lost his job over the Adarsh episode and also earned notoriety over the \u2018paid news' scandal. On the latter, Ashok Chavan faces a case in the Election Commission and might run into yet more trouble. His successor, imported from New Delhi, gives non-entity a bad name. The NCP, once a declining force, gets a new wind with his arrival. And that party gets more aggressive towards the Congress at the Centre as well, sensing the mess it is in. In Andhra Pradesh, two successive Chief Ministers have spent over a year fighting their own party in a State that contributed 33 MPs to the Congress at the Centre. In West Bengal, the Congress has written itself, with almost Lemming-like fatalism, into a distant third place.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIf you watch your Animal Planet you'd expect that, like in other social hierarchies, there are alpha male Lemmings. It requires rare qualities of leadership to guide a bunch of sharp front-toothed mammals off a cliff. Heading the charge means there are lots of large gnawing incisors just behind you. This is no role for the faint-hearted, as Kapil Sibal demonstrated in his stinging attack on the CAG. This was also what happened in the Bofors case, a blistering attack on the then CAG (among other things). The results of that strategy included a government drowning. But history is not the Lemming's long suit. Mr. Sibal might yet learn that the CAG is not a cowering witness in a court room, but the drowning will probably have begun by then. Meanwhile, with 2G, Raja, Radia, illicit funds, and a stubborn CVC, the UPA government's scams are multiplying faster than Lemmings.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nPranab Mukherjee, meanwhile, has made it clear \u2014 wagging a finger while doing so \u2014 that the government is not about to reveal the names of any tax evaders. Mr. Mukherjee, who heads more Groups of Ministers than have ever been Empowered, suggests there might be one more group soon. That is, to work out Amnesty schemes for tax evaders and those who have illegally siphoned funds out of the country to secret offshore accounts. No one can be named till they are prosecuted, says he. In other words, we will never know the names of those the government chooses not to prosecute.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nA Global Financial Integrity Report (<i>The Hindu</i>, Nov. 17, 2010) estimates that India has lost almost half a trillion dollars in illegal capital flight since Independence. As much as $125 billion, or more than a fourth of the total, vanished between just 2000 and 2008. The government plans amnesty for such offenders and arrests for those protesting high prices.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe line has also been laid down on food security: forget about it. There will be neither a universal PDS nor even an enhanced one. Feeding a hungry corporate world takes all the resources we have. Things are about to get much tougher for the whole team. India's premier Lemmings are simply too busy to pay any attention to their day jobs. Even as the onion season winds down, the World Cup Cricket and IPL seasons are about to begin. This means, of course, that we will still see no Agriculture Minister for a further two months. (Unless someone provokes him with a comment on Lavasa.) </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBack in 2008, as global food prices soared, Mr. Pawar revealed to the daily, <i>DNA</i> (Page 1, April 2), that the real reason why wheat prices were soaring was that south Indians were eating too many chapathis. In this, he echoed the view of noted nutritionist George W (then also working part-time as President of the United States). Mr. Bush declared that the world food prices were soaring because millions of Indians and Chinese were eating so much more. (Global prices fell sharply just months later. Were millions of Indians and Chinese suddenly starving? Or were big-time speculators giving prices a yo-yo ride?). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nDr. Singh and Montek Ahluwalia have also bought into the Bush Food Doctrine: the huge price rise in food items suggests that the poor are doing better, eating more. The cliff runway is free and the Lemmings have been cleared for takeoff.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>(The comments for this article appear at<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1167461.ece\"> this link</a>.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The Congressman with a mass following and appeal"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">It was about 6.30 in the evening on August 24. He broke away from addressing a gathering of bankers to have a chat with some of us on how the NREGS was doing in his State. And he was as concerned with its failures as he was pleased with its overall performance. The one point where Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy laughed was when we came to changing attitudes to the work among the village elites. Especially the decline of the contemptuous manner in which landowners used to summon Dalit or Adivasi labourers to work. \u201cThose old attitudes had to change,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"body\">Rewind to 2004. Andhra Pradesh was seen as the one State where the Congress had no chance of making a comeback in the polls. Those were the glory days of N. Chandrababu Naidu. Something YSR was soon to demolish. The terrible summer of 2003 had seen thousands of non-state \u201cgruel centres\u201d trying to combat a rising tide of hunger across Telangana and Rayalaseema. Remember, there was no NREGS then ( The Hindu Sunday Magazine, June 15 and 22, 2003: \u201cGruel Centres &amp; the Politics of Free Lunches and Hi-Tech, Low Nutrition\u201d).</p> <p class=\"body\">Today, in the drought, the NREGS works where gruel centres struggled. But in 2003, the phrase \u201cCongress leadership\u201d was a contradiction in terms in the State. Most of the State\u2019s senior Congressmen were themselves in awe of Chandrababu Naidu.</p> <p class=\"body\">YSR thought differently. He went out on a mass contact \u2018padayatra\u2019 and walked through village after village tapping the rising discontent. It would be wrong to call it, as some have called it, \u201can undercurrent.\u201d It was a torrent. One that YSR harnessed for a pathetic, demoralised, self-doubting party that leapt in alarm if the media just said \u2018boo.\u2019 Going to the spot was a practice he retained even after becoming Chief Minister. If he thought he saw a problem developing, he did not wait for it to come to him. This was so even with a natural calamity. As during the 2006 floods when he was all over the place directing relief operations \u2014 while his counterpart in Maharashtra, for instance, never got his feet wet.</p> <p class=\"body\">Years before that, when the national media were still dismissive of a spate of suicides among distressed farmers, Rajasekhara Reddy was quick to visit Bandi Lakshmamma in Anantapur. She was the wife of the first reported farm suicide victim to have caught attention in Andhra Pradesh, thanks to some exceptional reporting by a few reporters in the Telugu press. By April 2004, farmers\u2019 suicides were to be among the most decisive issues of the elections in Andhra Pradesh, both to the Lok Sabha and the Assembly.</p> <p class=\"body\">One of the first things Rajasekhara Reddy did upon becoming Chief Minister was to appoint an enthusiastic Agriculture Minister \u2014 Raghuveera Reddy from Anantapur, the district that had perhaps suffered the worst of the crisis.</p> <p class=\"body\">Together they tried to tackle the distress. No other State declared compensation payments to so many families affected by the suicide of their breadwinners. Andhra Pradesh set up a Commission, chaired by Professor Jayati Ghosh, to study the entire gamut of agrarian distress. The macro-policies of the State and the Centre conflicted with the thrust of the Commission\u2019s excellent report, but this was still the first such effort by any State to engage with the farm crisis.</p> <p class=\"body\">Rajasekhara Reddy as Chief Minister was ruthless, shrewd, alert and on-the-ball. Despite a larger vision that invited big trouble down the line \u2014 like his wrong and relentless stance on Special Economic Zones \u2014 he understood his State better than his colleagues. He saw the importance of hunger in all of Andhra Pradesh and not just in the rural regions. Rajasekhara Reddy massively added to the number of Below Poverty Line family cards in the State. His 2004 victory was viewed as a \u201crural revolt.\u201d In 2006, he swept the urban bodies, leading the Congress to an absolute majority in 68 municipalities and grabbing the chairperson\u2019s post in 75 out of 96.</p> <p class=\"body\">The great \u201cUSP\u201d of the Telugu Desam Party came with NTR\u2019s promise (and delivery) of rice at Rs. 2 a kg. The Congress of that time ridiculed the measure (now firmly in place in several States) and was buried in the electoral avalanche that followed. Years after the TDP moved away from that legacy, YSR was to grab it and even project it (in factual terms quite wrongly) as a Congress idea \u2014 Indiramma\u2019s dream. In 2009, cheap rice on the Public Distribution System proved a huge boost to all those governments providing it. Andhra Pradesh gave the Congress more MPs than any other State. More than Maharashtra and Karnataka put together. Rajasekhara Reddy had stolen the clothes the TDP had discarded. Among Congress Chief Ministers, he stood out as someone who was his own man. Irascible and on a short-fuse but decisive, he rose above and held together an incoherent and faction-ridden party. As a leader he was cocky, contradictory, yet often strangely convincing.</p> <p class=\"body\">The 2009 polls also saw him at his shrewd best. YSR was delighted when the Left opted to go with Chandrababu Naidu\u2019s TDP and not with Chiranjeevi\u2019s PRP. He was gambling on Chiranjeevi doing what Chiranjeevi did \u2014 draw away the anti-Congress vote. Rajasekhara Reddy was going by the only precedent there was \u2014 the 1978 State elections when the then \u201cBrahmananda Reddy Congress\u201d polled roughly what the PRP did this time, diverting the anti-Congress vote and gutting the Janata Party. That was the year YSR entered politics, and he remembered its lesson well. He ends his innings as the only Congressman in the State with a mass following and appeal, so evident in the outpouring of grief across the State.</p> <p class=\"body\">Rajasekhara Reddy\u2019s time in power also saw charges of corruption against his government, and a range of scandals in both government and the crony corporate world close to it. Like the Satyam scam.</p> <p class=\"body\">Some of those charges were serious, some of the scams massive.</p> <p class=\"body\">And some policies were very regressive. Still, on the NREGS, aspects of rural development, welfare schemes and pensions, he promoted and encouraged a fine if small group of officers who delivered.</p> <p class=\"body\">Distress migration fell as the NREGS expanded. In Anantapur, the number of people seeking work under the NREGS in just the first 15 days of August was 150 per cent higher than the number during the entire corresponding month last year. In many villages, almost every family sends a member to the NREGS site.</p> <p class=\"body\">But YSR\u2019s legacy will also carry the burden of some very damaging irrigation projects and a bizarre number of SEZs \u2014 103 approved at last count. The displacement all these will entail will be stunning and will affect one and a half million human beings or more. Some of those irrigation schemes will incur bills no one can pay. In that sense, he was lucky in Elections 2009. The progressive policies paid off. The outcome of the more negative policies will be felt later, perhaps around 2012, had he lived on.</p> <p class=\"body\">YSR was dynamic and effective, ruthless and authoritarian. An idea he liked would translate into an order shortly after he heard it. He seldom kept it pending. The suggestion that the Land Development Work under the NREGS in the State be prioritised to first benefit Dalit, Adivasi and women-headed households was such an idea. He also sat up at the mention of Dr. M.S. Swaminathan\u2019s idea of sending all students and faculty members of agricultural universities and colleges to the fields and farms for two months in this time of crisis. You could see he was making a note of it.</p> <p class=\"body\">Somebody was going to receive an order.</p>", "date": "September 4, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-congressman-with-a-mass-following-and-appeal/article14812.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["YSR", "Rajasekhara Reddy", "Congressman", "Andhra Pradesh CM", "NREGS", "TDP", "PRP", "Elections 2009", "Brahmananda Reddy Congress", "NTR", "Chandrababu Naidu"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Farm suicides: a 12-year saga "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The loan waiver year of 2008 saw 16,196 farm suicides in the country, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Compared to 2007, that\u2019s a fall of just 436. As economist Professor K. Nagaraj who has worked in-depth on farm suicide data says, \u201cthe numbers leave little room for comfort and none at all for self-congratulation.\u201d There were no major changes in the trend that set in from the late 1990s and worsened after 2002. The dismal truth is that very high numbers of farm suicides still occur within a fast decreasing farm population. </p> <p class=\"body\">Between just the Census of 1991 and that of 2001, nearly 8 million cultivators quit farming. A year from now, the 2011 Census will tell us how many more quit in this decade. It is not likely to be less. It could even dwarf that 8 million figure as the exodus from farming probably intensified after 2001. The State-wise farm suicide ratios \u2014 number of farmers committing suicide per 100,000 farmers \u2014 are still pegged on the outdated 2001 figures. So the 2011 Census, with more authentic counts of how many farmers there really are, might provide an unhappy update on what is going on.</p> <p class=\"body\">Focussing on farm suicides as a share of total suicides in India misleads. That way, it\u2019s \u201caha! the percentage is coming down.\u201d That\u2019s silly. For one thing, the total number of suicides (all groups, not just farmers) is increasing \u2014 in a growing population. Farm suicides are rising within a declining farm population. Two, an all-India picture disguises the intensity. The devastation lies in the Big 5 States (Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh). These account for two-thirds of all farm suicides during 2003-08. Take just the Big 5 \u2014 their percentage of all farm suicides has gone up. Worse, even their percentage of total all-India suicides (all categories) has risen. Poor States like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are doing very badly for some years now.</p> <p class=\"body\">In the period 1997-2002, farm suicides in the Big 5 States accounted for roughly one out of every 12 of all suicides in the country. In 2003-08, they accounted for nearly one out of every 10. </p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB now has farm suicide data for 12 years. Actually, farm data appear in its records from 1995 onwards, but some States failed to report for the first two years. Hence 1997, from when all States are reporting their farm suicide data, is a more reliable base year. The NCRB has also made access much easier by placing all past years of \u201cAccidental Deaths &amp; Suicides in India\u201d reports on its website. </p> <p class=\"body\">The 12-year period allows us to compare farm suicide numbers for 1997-2002, with how they turned out in the next 6-year period of 2003-2008. All 12 years were pretty bad, but the latter six were decidedly worse.</p> <p class=\"body\">Reading a \u2018trend\u2019 into a single year\u2019s dip or rise is misleading. Better to look at 3-year or 6-year periods within 1997-2008. For instance, Maharashtra saw a decline in farm suicide numbers in 2005, but the very next year proved to be its worst ever. Since 2006, the State has been the focus of many initiatives. Manmohan Singh\u2019s visit to Vidharbha that year brought the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s Relief Package\u201d of Rs.3,750 crore for six crisis-ridden districts of the region. This came atop Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh\u2019s Rs.1,075 crore \u201cCM\u2019s relief package.\u201d Then followed the nearly Rs.9,000 crore that was Maharashtra\u2019s share of the Rs.70,000-crore Central loan waiver for farmers. To which the State government added Rs.6,200 crore for those farmers not covered by the waiver. The State added Rs.500 crore for a one-time settlement (OTS) for poor farmers who had been excluded from the waiver altogether because they owned over five acres of land. </p> <p class=\"body\">In all, the amounts committed to fighting the agrarian crisis in Maharashtra exceeded Rs. 20,000 crore across 2006, 2007 and 2008. (And that\u2019s not counting huge handouts to the sugar barons.) Yet, that proved to be the worst three-year period ever for any State at any time since the recording of farm data began. In 2006-08, Maharashtra saw 12, 493 farm suicides. That is nearly 600 more than the previous worst of 2002-2005 and 85 per cent higher than the 6,745 suicides recorded in the three-year period of 1997-1999. The same government was in power, incidentally, in the worst six years. Besides, these higher numbers are emerging within a shrinking farm population. By 2001, 42 per cent of Maharashtra\u2019s population was already urban. Its farmer base has certainly not grown. </p> <p class=\"body\">So was the loan waiver useless? The idea of a waiver was not a bad thing. And it was right to intervene. More that the specific actions were misguided and bungled. Yet it could also be argued that but for the relief the waiver brought to some farmers at least, the suicide numbers of 2008 could have been a lot worse. The waiver was a welcome step for farmers, but its architecture was flawed. A point strongly made in this journal ( Oh! What a lovely waiver, March 10, 2008). It dealt only with bank credit and ignored moneylender debt. So only those farmers with access to institutional credit would benefit. Tenant farmers in Andhra Pradesh and poor farmers in Vidharbha and elsewhere get their loans mainly from moneylenders. So, in fact, farmers in Kerala, where everyone has a bank account, were more likely to gain. (Kerala was also the one State to address the issue of moneylender debt.) </p> <p class=\"body\">The 2008 waiver also excluded those holding over five acres, making no distinction between irrigated and unirrigated land. This devastated many struggling farmers with eight or 10 acres of poor, dry land. On the other hand, West Bengal\u2019s farmers, giant numbers of small holders below the 5-acre limit, stood to gain far more. </p> <p class=\"body\">Every suicide has a multiplicity of causes. But when you have nearly 200,000 of them, it makes sense to seek broad common factors within that group. Within those reasons. As Dr. Nagaraj has repeatedly pointed out, the suicides appear concentrated in regions of high commercialisation of agriculture and very high peasant debt. Cash crop farmers seemed far more vulnerable to suicide than those growing food crops. Yet the basic underlying causes of the crisis remained untouched. The predatory commercialisation of the countryside; a massive decline in investment in agriculture; the withdrawal of bank credit at a time of soaring input prices; the crash in farm incomes combined with an explosion of cultivation costs; the shifting of millions from food crop to cash crop cultivation with all its risks; the corporate hijack of every major sector of agriculture including, and especially, seed; growing water stress and moves towards privatisation of that resource. The government was trying to beat the crisis \u2014 leaving in place all its causes \u2014 with a one-off waiver. </p> <p class=\"body\">In late 2007, The Hindu carried (Nov. 12-15) the sorry result emerging from Dr. Nagaraj\u2019s study of NCRB data: that nearly 1.5 lakh peasants had ended their lives in despair between 1997 and 2005. Just days later, Union Minister for Agriculture Sharad Pawar confirmed those figures in Parliament (Rajya Sabha Starred Question No. 238, Nov. 30, 2007) citing the same NCRB data. It\u2019s tragic that 27 months later, the paper had to run a headline saying that the number had climbed to nearly 2 lakh. The crisis is very much with us. Mocking its victims, heckling its critics. And cosmetic changes won\u2019t make it go away. </p> <p class=\"body\">In 2006-08, Maharashtra saw 12, 493 farm suicides. That is 85 per cent higher than the 6,745 suicides it recorded during 1997-1999. And the worst three-year period for any State, any time. </p>", "date": "January 25, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/farm-suicides-a-12year-saga/article94324.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["farmers", "India", "suicide", "loan waiver", "drought", "debt"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Maharashtra polls: all fronts and no back "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Whatever the failings of Maharashtra\u2019s political class, and these are many, a lack of optimism is not among them. Even after the last date for the withdrawal of nominations to the Assembly elections, there are more fronts, real and imagined, alive and still in the making. More candidates, lots more spending. And a rebel-to-candidate ratio that can only be described as entertaining. The chaos and confusion are bewildering. A senior Shiv Sena figure, discarded by his party, contests the election as a Congress candidate. His nephew leaves the Sena to join the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena of Raj Thackeray. And that\u2019s one of the easier moves to follow.</p> <p class=\"body\">Yet, the key question in the race to control Maharashtra\u2019s 288-seat legislature boils down to: who will the fragmentation benefit? Will the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party gain from a multiplicity of fronts which could dissipate the anti-Congress vote? Or will the Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party benefit from the Third Front\u2019s cutting into the Congress-NCP vote? That is the million-dollar question. (And millions of dollars \u2014 or rupee equivalents \u2014 are being spent by parties to get the answer they like). Given the number of known faces in the fray for every seat, and the complexity of alliance and other factors, that answer might differ in each constituency.</p> <p class=\"body\">The Lok Sabha elections of April-May were a lot closer in this State than many might believe. The difference between the Congress-NCP and the Sena-BJP fronts was narrower than it appears at first glance. The former may have won 25 Lok Sabha seats and the latter only 20, but in terms of Assembly segments, the Congress-NCP combine led its saffron rivals by less than a dozen. Then too, there were others in the fray \u2014 which did make a significant, even decisive, difference to the poll outcome.</p> <p class=\"body\">The MNS, for instance, torpedoed the Sena-BJP in the Mumbai-Thane region. The MNS did not win a single Lok Sabha seat and led in very few segments, but the lakhs of votes it gathered in those was enough to hand the Congress-NCP victory in a State where they had assiduously pursued defeat. To this day, in the present round, the Congress strategy is mostly based on one assumption. That the MNS will fare even better in a State-level election where regional issues dominate. In short, a Congress-NCP win is predicated on how well the MNS does.</p> <p class=\"body\">There is not much else the Congress-NCP can count on. Massive job losses, a crippling price rise and abysmal governance are not the best platform to reach out to the voters on. The cheery confidence of the Congress, though, springs from the May Lok Sabha polls. In those, it lost four per cent in vote share compared to 2004 but gained four seats thanks to the MNS sinking the Sena. The Congress-NCP government\u2019s record is easily among the worst in the country. It\u2019s hard to find a single poll promise it actually fulfilled. Popular perception doesn\u2019t worry the parties much, though. In the Congress view, the math should do the trick this time, too. More so when the Opposition has failed to exploit major issues and discontent to put the ruling combine on the mat.</p> <p class=\"body\">In Vidarbha, the Bahujan Samaj Party did not lead in a single segment in May, but drew lakhs of votes across the region. Enough votes to torpedo the Sena-BJP in eastern Vidarbha\u2019s five Lok Sabha seats while blowing the Congress-NCP out of the water in the five seats of western Vidarbha. Lesson: you can determine the outcome of several contests even if your candidates run a distant third. In the Assembly polls, where State, regional and local-level issues gain weight, this volatility grows. </p> <p class=\"body\">And boy has it grown. The Republican Left Democratic Front (or \u2018third front\u2019) is a rickety outfit. But its member parties, where not squabbling with one another, can cause upsets in some constituencies. In some seats, though not many, its candidates are actually in the running. Former NCP rebels and other mavericks now with this front like Sadashiv Mandlik and Raju Shetty in Kolhapur could, where they are not fighting each other, pose big problems for the ruling alliance in its western Maharashtra stronghold. RPI unity, shallow, limited and unstable though it is, could help some third front candidates pick up a few thousand votes in some places. Votes that could topple a would-be winner in close contests. </p> <p class=\"body\">Then there is the BSP, which is contesting all 288 seats in the State. Its best bet in making an impact will again be Vidarbha. There, it could hurt both major fronts. However, the way this worked in May, it means the Sena-BJP is already ahead in about 30 of Vidarbha\u2019s\u2019s 62 segments, with the Congress-NCP ahead in only 27.</p> <p class=\"body\">Raj Thackeray\u2019s MNS is strongest in Mumbai-Thane, Pune and Nashik. The party is contesting around 140 seats across the State and could strike a sharp bargain when the results are out. Apart from the limited seats it will win, MNS candidates are strong in quite a few constituencies where the Congress-Sena race is really close. The MNS also strongly brings alive the Marathi versus non-Marathi issue. A factor which traps the Shiv Sena between proving its Marathi credentials and leading a broader alliance and agenda. But the greatest role of the MNS is in dividing the Sena vote. The media now see Raj Thackeray as the newsmaker of this election. In previous State polls \u2014 despite clear evidence of his decline in the past few years \u2014 a captive media saw only one newsmaker: Sharad Pawar. Today, they barely know where he is. </p> <p class=\"body\">The RPI of Prakash Ambedkar has struck its own path, declining to be part of the RLDF and contesting over 120 seats. Who will it affect the most? The Congress-NCP that counts on Dalit votes? Or will the Congress actually gain as the Dalit vote of the third front splinters?</p> <p class=\"body\">Next, there is Vinay Kore, Cabinet Minister in the present government, one-time NCP leader and weighty in western Maharashtra. His Jan Surajya Shakti (JSS) party has more than 50 candidates in the fray. Mr. Kore speaks of possible post-poll alliances with the MNS, stirring the pot before the stew is in it.</p> <p class=\"body\">And finally, there are the rebels \u2014 a factor that affects all parties in the contest. It would take a census to count the lot. Some of them are locally strong politicians who can make or mar their former party\u2019s chances in their boroughs. With all these factors and actors in play, several seats become hard to predict. The Congress has a simple attitude towards rebels: get elected on any platform you like, then join us in the government. This has often worked in Maharashtra.</p> <p class=\"body\">There are two ways of looking at who the RLDF or third front will hurt more. A widely-held view is that it must hurt the Congress-NCP. This is because the third front has voters (for instance, Dalits) who could otherwise go with the Congress-NCP but not with the Sena-BJP. And the Sena-BJP voter is most unlikely to be seduced by the RLDF. The Congress take on this is the opposite. It sees the multiple opposition fronts as splitting the anti-Congress, anti-NCP vote. It believes that the Third Front, the MNS and others will do for it what Chiranjeevi\u2019s Praja Rajyam Party did for Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in Andhra Pradesh \u2014 destroy the main rival by dividing the anti-Congress vote.</p> <p class=\"body\">It\u2019s another matter that Andhra Pradesh is a very different State and YSR was a cut above his Maharashtra counterparts. And that that government actually delivered on some programmes in the social sector. The Congress remains convinced that Maharashtra will witness a repeat of the Andhra math. It realises that if there were no MNS, the Sena-BJP would win. From this it concludes that the MNS being there assures the Congress-NCP alliance of victory. There is truth in the Congress logic that the division of the Marathi vote between the Senas will help. The gamble is on how much.</p> <p class=\"body\">Another curious aspect of the race in Maharashtra is that both the major alliances have one lame-duck partner with them. On the one side, the NCP seems to be imploding. On the other, the Sena is hamstrung by the BJP\u2019s decline. At this level, it\u2019s a question of which side\u2019s \u2018B\u2019 team will fare worse. And of how the \u2018A\u2019 sides will limp past the line when hobbled by partners who can\u2019t pull their own weight. </p> <p class=\"body\">In case of a hung Assembly, where neither major alliance crosses the 145-seat mark, the Congress-NCP will have an edge in government formation. They\u2019ve been in power 10 years. And when it comes to answering million-dollar questions, the more millions you have, the more it helps.</p>", "date": "September 30, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/maharashtra-polls-all-fronts-and-no-back/article26677.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Congress", "NCP", "anti-Congress vote", "Shiv Sena", "BJP", "Third Front", "RLDF", "Maharashtra Navnirman Sena", "MNS", "Raj Thackeray"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Maharashtra polls: Act II, Scene I "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nUnfazed by either drought or swine flu, the Congress party in the State was celebrating a victory in the upcoming Assembly elections even before these had been announced. The Congress-NCP alliance had won 25 of the State\u2019s 48 Lok Sabha seats in May this year. The rival Sena-BJP front won 20 and others took 3. This convinced the Congress of two things. One, they would repeat their win in the Assembly polls now set for October 13. The \u2018bounce\u2019 from the Lok Sabha win will boost them further. And two, the NCP is at their mercy (which at this point it does seem to be).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn the Lok Sabha polls this year, the Congress-NCP led in 133 of 288 Assembly segments. That\u2019s just eleven more than the number of segments the BJP-Sena alliance led in. If this were repeated in the Assembly polls, neither side would have a majority on its own. And new fronts will cause upsets in sundry seats. Then what accounts for the confidence? In two words \u2014 Raj Thackeray. The MNS\u2019s showing torpedoed the Shiv Sena in the Mumbai-Thane region. (Never mind that these polls could be fought on different terms and issues.)\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nWith voting just over a month away, it\u2019s worth asking: How has this State done in the past few years? How have governments performed? </p> <p class=\"body\">\nMaharashtra lost two million jobs before the \u201ceconomic slowdown\u201d began. Food production was reckoned to have fallen 24 per cent \u2014 oilseeds 49 per cent and sugarcane 43 per cent \u2014 in 2008-09. All that, without a drought. The State is third from the bottom in the country in terms of people living in poverty. Fifth from the bottom in terms of percentages. Over thirty million people, or close to a third of Maharashtra\u2019s population, are BPL. It is also the State worst-hit by a policy-driven agrarian crisis \u2014 a very different thing from drought. It has seen over 40,000 farmers suicides since 1995.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe State government\u2019s own economic survey reveals plenty. It shows that employment in Maharashtra, \u201cwhich was on the rise till 2004-05 at 4.3 crore, declined to 4.1 crore in 2007-08, clearly indicating the footprint of recession.\u201d The last six words are a joke. That figure ends at March 2008. The global shock struck more than five months later. It does raise the question, though: if the State could lose so many jobs before the slowdown, how many must have vanished once that began? </p> <p class=\"body\">\nMaharashtra lost those two million jobs in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08. It means that, on average, over 1,800 people lost their jobs every day in that period. In a time of rising food prices (and falling foodgrain output in the State). So how did it fare in 2008-09? We don\u2019t know the half of it. But we do know that employment generation under various schemes fell 30 per cent. In fact a drop of 18 million days compared to 2007-08.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nHowever, it was also during that time that India made steady progress in the Forbes lists of dollar billionaires, crossing the 51 mark (i.e. Rank 4 in the world) by 2008. More than 20 of those billionaires had an address in Mumbai. One of them is doing the city proud, building what must rank amongst the costliest residences in the planet. That, while over half the people in his city rot in slums. His Xanadu \u2014 with 27 storeys and three helipads \u2014 will be a tourist landmark. Also a shining symbol of the obscene inequality this State revels in. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAs the price rise shredded household budgets these past few years, some governments tried to reduce its impact on their people. Those in Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, amongst others, unilaterally increased the \u201cBPL population\u201d in their states. They then gave them cheap rice at Rs. 2 a kilo. (Or even Rs. 1 a kilo as in Tamil Nadu). The government of Maharashtra did nothing of the sort. The number of workdays fell when a hungry population needed them most.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nNext door, Andhra Pradesh mourns a chief minister who will be remembered for boosting the NREGs, old age and women\u2019s pensions, and rice at Rs. 2 a kilo. The previous chief minister of Maharashtra\u2019s most memorable moment came when he visited the terror-attack shattered Taj and Trident Hotels with his actor son and Bollywood\u2019s Ram Gopal Varma in tow. Disaster tourists checking out the rich cinematic promise thrown up by the tragic events. But he too cared for the down and out, too, he told the media. After all, pointed out Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, he had not prosecuted all those farmers committing suicide in his State on his watch. \u201cCommitting suicide is an offence under the Indian Penal Code. But did we book any farmer for this offence? Have you reported that?\u201d ( The Hindustan Times, October 31, 2007). </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe present Chief Minister, less given to such talk, nonetheless declares he will take the State even further ahead. \u201cIt is my dream to raise the per capita income in the state to Rs. 1 lakh.\u201d Well he\u2019s got part of it right. It is a dream. The government is proud that Maharashtra\u2019s per capita income (2007-08) \u201cis higher than the national income.\u201d And that \u201cthe State ranks second after Haryana among the major states of India.\u201d The State\u2019s per capita income was a hefty Rs. 47,051. Per capita National Income was a piffling Rs. 33,282.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe State\u2019s per capita income is an odd construct resting on a few rich regions. Move out of those and it plummets. Mumbai \u2014 home to more dollar billionaires than all the Nordic nations put together in 2008 \u2014 has a per capita income of Rs. 73,930. In the well-off Konkan region that is Rs. 66,197. Get down to Aurangabad in Marathwada and you\u2019re looking at Rs. 30,499. Cross into Vidharbha and you\u2019re a little over Rs. 29,000. So the Rs. 47,051 figure reflects no one\u2019s reality well. What\u2019s clear are the stunning regional, class and caste inequalities of the State.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nOnly Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have more human beings below the poverty line than Maharashtra does. In percentage terms (at 30.7 per cent BPL), the State moves up a slot \u2014 above Madhya Pradesh amongst bigger states. In 1993-94, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Maharashtra had more or less the same BPL ratio \u2014 around 36 per cent. By 2004-05 those two states had sharply reduced their poverty figures both in absolute terms and in percentages. Maharashtra\u2019s percentage fell much less than theirs. And the Sate\u2019s total BPL number went up not down. But heck, let\u2019s dream. Rs. 1 lakh per capita income it shall be.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nMumbai, too, with all its wealth, has its own Third World within: The National Family Health Survey (NFHS - 3) shows us that 40 per cent of children below 3 years of age in Mumbai are malnourished. That, by the way, is higher than the State\u2019s average. Mumbai also has millions who live on less than Rs. 19 a day. Yet rural-urban disparities, too, are real. As the NGO Sathi points out in its \u201cReport on Health Inequities in Maharashtra,\u201d the rural parts of the state have 22 hospital beds per lakh of population. In urban Maharashtra, that is 431 beds. This does not stop the government from claiming to be \u201cat the forefront of health care development in India.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nPer capita foodgrain production in Maharashtra was just about 100 kilograms (2004-05) says the State\u2019s economic survey. (That\u2019s a nearly 40 per cent deficit against its minimum requirement.) It was around 212 in Madhya Pradesh, 166 in Andhra Pradesh, 186 in Karnataka, all neighbours. It was 262 kg in Bihar at the time. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAnd then there\u2019s all those farmers the government was nice to. The suicide victims it did not prosecute. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data reveal 40,666 farmers suicides in Maharashtra between 1995 and 2007. The State accounts for over a fifth of all such deaths in India. In 2007, Maharashtra logged over 38 per cent of all farm suicides in the five States worst-hit by the phenomenon. It was the only State that saw, since 1997, an increase of over 100 per cent in farm suicides \u2014 while actually recording a two per cent decline in suicides by non-farmers.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAll this has not dampened the Congress\u2019 spirit. It is sure it will win the way it did in the Lok Sabha polls: against a split opposition, with the Shiv Sena hobbled by a lame duck BJP on the one hand and undercut by an aggressive Raj Thackeray on the other. But there are more fronts in the fray across the State this time. And with multi-cornered contests in almost all seats, there could be some major upsets. The more so in a situation where no one is sitting on a majority.\n</p>", "date": "September 7, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/maharashtra-polls-act-ii-scene-i/article16095.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Assembly", "Elections", "polls", "Congress", "NCP", "BJP", "Shiv Sena", "Sonia Gandhi", "Ashok Chavan", "Sharad Pawar", "Uddhav Thackeray", "Bal Thackeray", "Raj Thackeray"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["A candle in the wind "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The front rows of the Mumbai-Nagpur flight are usually the province of the political class: MLAs to MPs, ministers and fixers. This time, though, quite a few of the occupants were celebrities: television and film stars, major and minor, middling and mediocre. It wasn\u2019t the T-20 cricket match in Nagpur drawing them, but a far greater sport. They were going to Vidarbha for the last two days of campaigning before polling day. Shameless eavesdropping did not help us figure out which candidates specifically they were to campaign for. It wasn\u2019t evident that they knew much about that themselves. Logistics seemed a more major concern. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d grumbled one little celeb to a neighbour. \u201cYou have to travel just half an hour out of Nagpur. The place I\u2019m going is about three hours drive away.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In fairness to them, their failure to mention any issue at all they would be campaigning on was no worse (and less pretentious) than the performance of the major political parties in Maharashtra on the same score. In a State where the issues hurl themselves at you \u2014 and in a region where they kick you in the face \u2014 the opposition failed to mount a strong campaign on a single one of them. Armed with weapons that could slaughter one of the worst performing State governments in decades \u2014 from millions of job losses to food prices and the fall in food production, to the farm crisis \u2014 they did nothing. Call it electoral ahimsa. The voting public might still ram home those issues on their own in today\u2019s polling, but it could be a response divided between too many fronts.</p> <p class=\"body\">Even in Western Vidarbha which rejected the Congress-NCP in every one of its five Lok Sabha seats this May, the paralysis of the opposition is apparent. So much so that President Pratibha Patil\u2019s son, Rajendra Shekhawat, who was struggling just a week ago in Amravati, is now in the race and doing not so badly. That too against a far more experienced and locally-rooted Sunil Deshmukh \u2014 twice MLA from here and a Minister of State \u2014 who locals see as betrayed by the Congress when they denied him the ticket. The BJP candidate seems not to be in the race at all. </p> <p class=\"body\">The Sena-BJP led in 30 of Vidharbha\u2019s 62 Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha polls. The Congress-NCP in 27. But that advantage has not been anchored or expanded by the saffron front as much as it might have been. A poor choice of candidates and a lack of fire on the issues have offset any offensive. As Vidharbha\u2019s leading intellectual on agrarian issues, Vijay Jawandhia, says: \u201cThis year, the soybean crop has failed. The cotton crop is in trouble. The ground water level is twenty feet below normal for this time of year. And there will be no rabi crop. Support prices are a mess. And on the credit front, we are heading for disaster. The impact of these two successive years of drought could be worse than it was in 1972.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The Lashkari-alli (or military worm) has consumed much of the soybean crop in just days \u2014 and destroyed farmers such as Arju Kavdoji Tarekar in Seoni Rasalapur in Amravati. He tried taking his life on Independence Day after finding all the crop on his nine-acre, rain-fed farm gone overnight. \u201cI have never seen pest consume such a large area so quickly,\u201d he says. He went to appeal for help from the Tehsildar\u2019s office where \u201cthey abused me and turned me away, asking why I had come there. Where else could I go?\u201d Devastated, Tarekar tried ending his life on the spot by swallowing pesticide but failed. \u201cThe police were called in. They arrested me, took me away, detained me for a day and yelled at me: \u2018Why die here? Go die in your own fields and don\u2019t trouble us.\u2019\u201d He still receives the odd oral \u2018summons\u2019 to appear and explain his \u2018crime.\u2019 </p> <p class=\"body\">But while farmers reel under crop failure, it was hard to find this focused on in the campaigns. In a region where several candidates and re-contesting MLAs have increased their assets by over 1,000 per cent since 2004, the thrust is different. One liquor baron has sought to keep voters\u2019 spirits up in the way he knows best and at huge expense. Thousands were also out canvassing for candidates they cared little about (and may not even vote for). For people finding little or no work, the daily payment and meals on the campaign trail were welcome. The campaigns were costly, competing chaos.</p> <p class=\"body\">In a State where a single MLA increased his assets by Rs. 520 million between his election in 2004 and this year; where MLAs of the outgoing Assembly saw their assets rise by 339 per cent on average in that period, it was sobering to run into Babytai Bais. She is contesting from Wani in Yavatmal district as an independent, supported by the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS). Her aim: \u201cto unite the 7,000 farm widows and 35,000 orphans of Vidarbha whose concerns are common, to lead a life of dignity and honour.\u201d Babytai\u2019s indebted husband was one of thousands of farmers in the region who committed suicide during this past decade, crushed by the ongoing agrarian crisis. Their farm land remains in the name of his father, which leaves Babytai with nothing. Even their small house (worth Rs.50,000) that finds mention in her affidavit is not in her name. She\u2019ll be lucky to see it transferred to her son\u2019s name at some point, not her own.</p> <p class=\"body\">So what assets has she, anyway? Just one: a fixed deposit of Rs. 70,000 \u2014 exactly the compensation amount for the loss of her husband that the government placed in a bank for her. That too, in an account jointly held with the district Collector. That\u2019s it. She has nothing more. Except the candle that is her poll symbol. Babytai came into the fray very late, after Kalavati\u2019s sudden withdrawal. So she has had barely ten days to get her campaign going from scratch. Yet, she contests, taking seriously her responsibility towards thousands of other \u2018farm widows and orphans\u2019 in the region. Up against the most awesome money power, it\u2019s almost impossible for her to win, and she knows it. But she might just have lit that candle.</p>", "date": "October 13, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/a-candle-in-the-wind/article33086.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Vidarbha", "Maharashtra", "aseembly elections", "political parties", "Babytai", "Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The medium, message and the money "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\nC. Ram Pandit can now resume his weekly column. Dr. Pandit (name changed) had long been writing for a well-known Indian language newspaper in Maharashtra. On the last day for the withdrawal of nominations to the recent State Assembly elections, he found himself sidelined. An editor at the paper apologised to him saying: \u201cPanditji, your columns will resume after October 13. Till then, every page in this paper is sold.\u201d The editor, himself an honest man, was simply speaking the truth.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nIn the financial orgy that marked the Maharashtra elections, the media were never far behind the moneybags. Not all sections of the media were in this mode, but quite a few. Not just small local outlets, but powerful newspapers and television channels, too. Many candidates complained of \u201cextortion\u201d but were not willing to make an issue of it for fear of drawing media fire. Some senior journalists and editors found themselves profoundly embarrassed by their managements. \u201cThe media have been the biggest winners in these polls,\u201d says one ruefully. \u201cIn this period alone,\u201d says another, \u201cthey\u2019ve more than bounced back from the blows of the \u2018slowdown\u2019 and done so in style.\u201d Their poll-period take is estimated to be in hundreds of millions of rupees. Quite a bit of this did not come as direct advertising but in packaging a candidate\u2019s propaganda as \u201cnews.\u201d\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Assembly elections saw the culture of \u201ccoverage packages\u201d explode across the State. In many cases, a candidate just had to pay for almost any coverage at all. Issues didn\u2019t come into it. No money, no news. This effectively shut out smaller parties and independent voices with low assets and resources. It also misled viewers and readers by denying them any mention of the real issues some of these smaller forces raised. <i>The Hindu</i> reported on this (April 7, 2009) during the Lok Sabha elections, where sections of the media were offering low-end \u201ccoverage packages\" for Rs.15 lakh to Rs.20 lakh. \u201cHigh-end\u201d ones cost a lot more. The State polls saw this go much further. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nNone of this, as some editors point out, is new. However, the scale is new and stunning. The brazenness of it (both ways) quite alarming. And the game has moved from the petty personal corruption of a handful of journalists to the structured extraction of huge sums of money by media outfits. One rebel candidate in western Maharashtra, calculates an editor from that region, spent Rs.1 crore \u201con just local media alone.\u201d And, points out the editor, \u201che won, defeating the official candidate of his party.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe deals were many and varied. A candidate had to pay different rates for \u2018profiles,\u2019 interviews, a list of \u2018achievements,\u2019 or even a trashing of his rival in some cases. (With the channels, it was \u201clive\u201d coverage, a \u2018special focus,\u2019 or even a team tracking you for hours in a day.) Let alone bad-mouthing your rival, this \u201cpay-per\u201d culture also ensures that the paper or channel will not tell its audiences that you have a criminal record. Over 50 per cent of the MLAs just elected in Maharashtra have criminal charges pending against them. Some of them featured in adulatory \u201cnews items\u201d which made no mention of this while tracing their track record.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAt the top end of the spectrum, \u201cspecial supplements\u201d cost a bomb. One put out by one of the State\u2019s most important politicians \u2014 celebrating his \u201cera\u201d \u2014 cost an estimated Rs.1.5 crore. That is, just this single media insertion cost 15 times what he is totally allowed to spend as a candidate. He has won more than the election, by the way. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nOne common low-end package: Your profile and \u201cfour news items of your choice\u201d to be carried for between Rs.4 lakh or more depending on which page you seek. There is something chilling about those words \u201cnews items of your choice.\u201d Here is news on order. Paid for. (Throw in a little extra and a writer from the paper will help you draft your material.) It also lent a curious appearance to some newspaper pages. For instance, you could find several \u201cnews items\u201d of exactly the same size in the same newspaper on the same day, saying very different things. Because they were really paid-for propaganda or disguised advertisements. A typical size was four columns by ten centimetres. When a pro-saffron alliance paper carries \u201cnews items\u201d of this size extolling the Congress-NCP, you know strange things are happening. (And, oh yes, if you bought \u201cfour news items of your choice\u201d many times, a fifth one might be thrown in gratis.)\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere were a few significant exceptions to the rule. A couple of editors tried hard to bring balance to their coverage and even ran a \u201cnews audit\u201d to ensure that. And journalists who, as one of them put it, \u201csimply stopped meeting top contacts in embarrassment.\u201d Because, often, journalists with access to politicians were expected to make the approach. That information came from a reporter whose paper sent out an email detailing \u201ctargets\u201d for each branch and edition during the elections. The bright exceptions were drowned in the flood of lucre. And the huge sums pulled in by that paper have not stopped it from sacking droves of staffers. Even from editions that met their \u2018targets.\u2019\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere are the standard arguments in defence of the whole process. Advertising packages are the bread and butter of the industry. What\u2019s wrong with that? \u201cWe have packages for the festive season. Diwali packages, or for the Ganesh puja days.\u201d Only, the falsehoods often disguised as \u201cnews\u201d affect an exercise central to India\u2019s electoral democracy. And are outrageously unfair to candidates with less or no money. They also amount to exerting undue influence on the electorate.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThere is another poorly assessed \u2014 media-related \u2014 dimension to this. Many celebrities may have come out in May to exhort people to vote. This time, several of them appear to have been hired by campaign managers to drum up crowds for their candidate. Rates unknown.\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nAll of this goes hand in hand with the stunning rise of money power among candidates. More so among those who made it the last time and have amassed huge amounts of wealth since 2004. With the media and money power wrapped like two peas in a pod, this completely shuts out smaller, or less expensive, voices. It just prices the <i>aam aadmi</i> out of the polls. Never mind they are contested in his name. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nYour chances of winning an election to the Maharashtra Assembly, if you are worth over Rs.100 million, are 48 times greater than if you were worth just Rs.1 million or less. Far greater still, if that other person is worth only half-a-million rupees or less. Just six out of 288 MLAs in Maharashtra who won their seats declared assets of less than half-a-million rupees. Nor should challenges from garden variety multi-millionaires (those worth between Rs.1 million-10 million) worry you much. Your chances of winning are six times greater than theirs, says the National Election Watch (NEW).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe number of \u2018crorepati\u2019 MLAs (those in the Rs.10 million-plus category) in the State Assembly has gone up by over 70 per cent in the just concluded elections. There were 108 elected in 2004. This time, there are 184. Nearly two-thirds of the MLAs just elected in Maharashtra and close to three-fourths of those in Haryana, are crorepatis. These and other startling facts fill the reports put out by NEW, a coalition of over 1,200 civil society groups across the country that also brought out excellent reports on these issues during the Lok Sabha polls in April-May. Its effort to inform the voting public is spearheaded by the NGO, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nEach MLA in Maharashtra, on average, is worth over Rs.40 million. That is, if we treat their own poll affidavit declarations as genuine. That average is boosted by Congress and BJP MLAs who seem richer than the others, being well above that mark.

The switchover from the conventional cotton to Bollgard or Bt Cotton here has led to a social and economic transformation in the villages [of Bhambraja and Antargaon] in the past three-four years.\u201d (</i>Times of India<i>, October 31, 2008).</i>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<i>So heartening was this account that nine months ago, the same story was run again in the same newspaper, word for word. (</i>Times of India<i>, August 28, 2011). Never mind that the villagers themselves had a different story to tell.</i>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cThere have been 14 suicides in our village,\u201d a crowd of agitated farmers in Bhambraja told shocked members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture in March this year. \u201cMost of them after Bt came here.\u201d <i>The Hindu </i>was able to verify nine that had occurred between 2003 and 2009. Activist groups count five more since then. All after 2002, the year the TOI story says farmers here switched to Bt. Prospering on agriculture? The villagers told the visibly shaken MPs: \u201cSir, lots of land is lying fallow. Many have lost faith in farming.\u201d Some have shifted to soybean where \u201cat least the losses are less.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nOver a hundred people, including landed farmers, have migrated from this \u2018model farming village' showcasing Mahyco-Monsanto Biotech's Bt Cotton. \u201cMany more will leave because agriculture is dying,\u201d Suresh Ramdas Bhondre had predicted during our first visit to Bhambraja last September. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe 2008 full-page panegyric in the TOI on Monsanto's Bt Cotton rose from the dead soon after the government failed to introduce the Biotech Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) Bill in Parliament in August 2011. The failure to table the Bill \u2014 crucial to the future profits of the agri-biotech industry \u2014 sparked frenzied lobbying to have it brought in soon. The full-page, titled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/01078/A_facsimile_of__i__1078418a.pdf\">Reaping Gold through Bt Cotton</a> on August 28 was followed by a flurry of advertisements from Mahyco-Monsanto Biotech (India) Ltd., in the TOI (and some other papers), starting the very next day. These appeared on August 29, 30, 31, September 1 and 3. The Bill finally wasn't introduced either in the monsoon or winter session \u2014 though listed for business in both \u2014 with Parliament bogged down in other issues. Somebody did reap gold, though, with newsprint if not with Bt Cotton. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture appeared unimpressed by the ad barrage, which also seemed timed for the committee's deliberations on allowing genetically modified food crops. Disturbed by reports of mounting farm suicides and acute distress in Vidarbha, committee members, who belong to different parties, decided to visit the region. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBhambraja, touted as a model for Mahyco-Monsanto's miracle Bt, was an obvious destination for the committee headed by veteran parliamentarian Basudeb Acharia. Another was Maregaon-Soneburdi. But the MPs struck no gold in either village. Only distress arising from the miracle's collapse and a raft of other, government failures. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe issues (and the claims made by the TOI in its stories) have come alive yet again with the debate sparked off by the completion of 10 years of Bt cotton in India in 2012. The \u201cReaping Gold through Bt Cotton\u201d that appeared on August 28 last year, presented itself as \u201cA consumer connect initiative.\u201d In other words, a paid-for advertisement. The bylines, however, were those of professional reporters and photographers of the <i>Times of India</i>. More oddly, the story-turned-ad had already appeared, word-for-word, in the <i>Times of India</i>, Nagpur on October 31, 2008. The repetition was noticed and ridiculed by critics. The August 28, 2011 version itself acknowledged this unedited \u2018reprint' lightly. What appeared in 2008, though, was not marked as an advertisement. What both versions do acknowledge is: \u201cThe trip to Yavatmal was arranged by Mahyco-Monsanto Biotech.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe company refers to the 2008 feature as \u201ca full-page news report\u201d filed by the TOI. \u201cThe 2008 coverage was a result of the media visit and was based on the editorial discretion of the journalists involved. We only arranged transport to-and-from the fields,\u201d a Mahyco Monsanto Biotech India spokesperson told <i>The Hindu </i>last week. \u201cThe 2011 report was an unedited reprint of the 2008 coverage as a marketing feature.\u201d The 2008 \u201cfull-page news report\u201d appeared in the Nagpur edition. The 2011 \u201cmarketing feature\u201d appeared in multiple editions (which you can click to online under \u2018special reports') but not in Nagpur, where it would surely have caused astonishment. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nSo the same full-page appeared twice in three years, the first time as news, the second time as an advertisement. The first time done by the staff reporter and photographer of a newspaper. The second time exhumed by the advertising department. The first time as a story trip \u2018arranged by Mahyco-Monsanto.' The second time as an advertisement arranged by Mahyco-Monsanto. The first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe company spokesperson claimed high standards of transparency in that \u201c\u2026we insisted that the publication add the source and dateline as follows: \u2018This is a reprint of a story from the <i>Times of India</i>, Nagpur edition, October 31, 2008.' But the spokesperson's e-mail reply to <i>The Hindu</i>'s questions is silent on the timing of the advertisements. \u201cIn 2011, we conducted a communications initiative for a limited duration aimed at raising awareness on the role of cotton seeds and plant biotechnologies in agriculture.\u201d Though <i>The Hindu </i>raised the query, there is no mention of why the ads were run during the Parliament session when the BRAI Bill was to have come up, but didn't. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBut there's more. Some of the glowing photographs accompanying the TOI coverage of the Bt miracle were not taken in Bhambraja or Antargaon, villagers allege. \u201cThis picture is not from Bhambraja, though the people in it are\u201d says farmer Babanrao Gawande from that village. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>Phantom miracle</b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe <i>Times of India </i>story had a champion educated farmer in Nandu Raut who is also an LIC agent. His earnings shot up with the Bt miracle. \u201cI made about Rs.2 lakhs the previous year,\u201d Nandu Raut told me last September. \u201cAbout Rs.1.6 lakh came from the LIC policies I sold.\u201d In short, he earned from selling LIC policies four times what he earned from farming. He has seven and a half acres and a four-member family. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nBut the TOI story has him earning \u201cRs.20,000 <i>more per acre</i> (emphasis added) due to savings in pesticide.\u201d Since he grew cotton on four acres, that was a \u201csaving\u201d of Rs. 80,000 \u201con pesticide.\u201d Quite a feat. As many in Bhambraja say angrily: \u201cShow us one farmer here earning Rs.20,000 per acre at all, let alone that much more per acre.\u201d A data sheet from a village-wide survey signed by Mr. Raut (in <i>The Hindu</i>'s possession) also tells a very different story on his earnings. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe ridicule that Bhambraja and Maregaon farmers pour on the Bt \u2018miracle' gains credence from the Union Agriculture Minister's figures. \u201cVidarbha produces about 1.2 quintals [cotton lint] per hectare on average,\u201d Sharad Pawar told Parliament on December 19, 2011. That is a shockingly low figure. Twice that figure would still be low. The farmer sells his crop as raw cotton. One-hundred kg of raw cotton gives 35 kg of lint and 65 kg of cotton seed (of which up to two kg is lost in ginning). And Mr. Pawar's figure translates to just 3.5 quintals of raw cotton per hectare. Or merely 1.4 quintals per acre. Mr. Pawar also assumed farmers were getting a high price of Rs.4,200 per quintal. He conceded that this was close to \u201cthe cost of cultivation\u2026 and that is why I think such a serious situation is developing there.\u201d If Mr. Pawar's figure was right, it means Nandu Raut's <b><i>gross income </i></b>could not have exceeded Rs.5,900 per acre. Deduct his input costs \u2014 of which 1.5 packets of seed alone accounts for around Rs.1,400 \u2014 and he's left with almost nothing. Yet, the TOI has him earning \u201cRs.20,000 more per acre.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nAsked if they stood by these extraordinary claims, the Mahyco-Monsanto spokesperson said, \u201cWe stand by the quotes of our MMB India colleague, as published in the news report.\u201d Ironically, that single-paragraph quote, in the full-page-news story-turned-ad, makes no mention of the Rs.20,000-plus per acre earnings or any other figure. It merely speaks of Bt creating \u201cincreased income of cotton growers\u2026\u201d and of growth in Bt acreage. It does not mention per acre yields. And says nothing about zero suicides in the two villages. So the company carefully avoids direct endorsement of the TOI's claims, <i>but uses them in a marketing feature where they are the main points</i>. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe MMB spokesperson's position on these claims is that \u201cthe journalists spoke directly with farmers on their personal experiences during the visits, resulting in various news reports, including the farmer quotes.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe born-again story-turned-ad also has Nandu Raut reaping yields of \u201cabout 20 quintals per acre with Bollgard II,\u201d nearly 14 times the Agriculture Minister's average of 1.4 quintals per acre. Mr. Pawar felt that Vidarbha's rainfed irrigation led to low yields, as cotton needs \u201ctwo to three waterings.\u201d He was silent on why Maharashtra, ruled by an NCP-Congress alliance, promotes Bt Cotton in almost entirely rainfed regions. The Maharashtra State Seed Corporation (Mahabeej) distributes the very seeds the State's Agriculture Commissioner found to be unsuited for rainfed regions seven years ago. Going by the TOI, Nandu is rolling in cash. Going by the Minister, he barely stays afloat. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nMahyco-Monsanto Biotech's ad barrage the same week in 2011 drew other fire. Following a complaint, one of the ads (also appearing in another Delhi newspaper) claiming huge monetary benefits to Indian farmers landed before the Advertising Standards Council of India. ASCI \u201cconcluded that the claims made in the advertisement and cited in the complaint, were not substantiated.\u201d The MMB spokesperson said the company \u201ctook cognizance of the points made by ASCI and revised the advertisement promptly\u2026. ASCI has, on record, acknowledged MMB India's modification of the advertisement\u2026\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">\nWe met Nandu again as the Standing Committee MPs left his village in March. \u201cIf you ask me today,\u201d he said, \u201cI would say don't use Bt here, in unirrigated places like this. Things are now bad.\u201d He had not raised a word during the meeting with the MPs, saying he had arrived too late to do so. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n\u201cWe have thrown away the moneylender. No one needs him anymore,\u201d <i>The Times of India</i> news report-turned-ad quotes farmer Mangoo Chavan as saying. That's in Antargaon, the other village the newspaper found to be basking in Bt-induced prosperity. A study of the 365 farm households in Bhambraja and the nearly 150 in Antargaon by the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS) shows otherwise. \u201cAlmost all farmers with bank accounts are in critical default and 60 per cent of farmers are also in debt to private moneylenders,\u201d says VJAS chief Kishor Tiwari. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nThe Maharashtra government tried hard to divert the MPs away from the \u2018model village' of Bhambraja (and Maregaon) to places where the government felt in control. However, Committee Chairperson Basudeb Acharia and his colleagues stood firm. Encouraged by the MPs visit, people in both places spoke their minds and hearts. Maharashtra's record of over 50,000 farm suicides between 1995 and 2010 is the worst in the country as the data of the National Crime Records Bureau show. And Vidarbha has long led the State in such deaths. Yet, the farmers also spoke of vast, policy-linked issues driving agrarian distress here. </p> <p class=\"body\">\nNone of the farmers reduced the issue of the suicides or the crisis to being only the outcome of Bt Cotton. But they punctured many myths about its miracles, costs and \u2018savings.' Some of their comments came as news to the MPs. And not as paid news or a marketing feature, either. </p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b>(Disclosure: <i>The Hindu</i> and <i>The Times of India </i>are competitors in several regions of India.) </b>\n</p> <p class=\"body\">\n<b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article3401468.ece\">The Times of India response</a></b>\n</p>", "date": "May 10, 2012", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/reaping-gold-through-cotton-and-newsprint/article3401466.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Times of India Bt Cotton report", "Bhambraja farmer suicides", "Mahyco-Monsanto Biotech", "agri-biotech industry", "Maregaon farmers", "Bt Cotton farming", "paid news", "genetically modified cotton"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The agony & the ajaat"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Amitabh Bachchan says that if ever asked about his caste by Census enumerators, his answer would be: Caste \u2013 Indian. That, of course, would do little more than stoke the media's bollywood feeding frenzy yet again. Shyam Maharaj is no Bachchan. Nor is his brother, Chaitanya Prabhu. But they and the followers of their fraternity will likely throw up far more complex answers \u2014 and questions \u2014 if Census enumerators do finally pop that query on caste. \u201cOur answer: we are <i>ajaat</i>. Here is my school leaving certificate to prove that. But you can write what you like,\u201d Prabhu tells us at his house in Mangrul (Dastgir) village of Amravati district.</p> <p class=\"body\"><i>Ajaat</i>: this literally means ones without caste. The <i>ajaat</i> was a bold social movement of the 1920s and '30s that at its peak had tens of thousands of committed followers in what are present-day Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. It was led by the colourful and eccentric social reformer Ganpati Bhabhutkar better known as Ganpati Maharaj. Chaitanya Prabhu and Shyam Maharaj are his surviving grandsons. Apart from the usual anti-liquor and anti-violence norms of such movements, Ganpati Maharaj threw in others. He attacked caste frontally. Many stopped idol worship at his call. He pressed for gender equality and even railed against private property. And, in the 1930s, he and his followers declared themselves as \u2018<i>ajaat</i>.'</p> <p class=\"body\">His inter-caste dining drive raised hackles in the villages he worked in. As one of his disciples P. L. Nimkar put it: \u201che would ask his followers from all castes to bring cooked food from their homes. This, he would mix up totally and distribute the mix as prasad.\u201d Caste was his great target. \u201cInter-caste weddings and widow remarriage \u2014 that's what he sought and achieved,\u201d says Prabhu. \u201cIn our own family, from granddad to us, we married into eleven different castes, from brahmins to dalits. In our extended family there have been scores of such weddings. Ganpati Maharaj himself had such a marriage.\u201d He also \u201ccreated the religion of \u2018<i>maanav</i>' (humanity) and opened the temple here to dalits, offending the upper castes,\u201d says Shyam Maharaj. \u201cThey filed cases against him and no one would touch his case. All the <i>vakils</i> here at the time were brahmins.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The movement waned over years, as some followers left on the caste issue, and with its Gurus's death in 1944. (He is buried at a community centre he built here decades ago, just opposite Prabhu's home). Still, it remained known and respected for some time after independence. \u201cSee my school leaving certificate,\u201d says Prabhu, showing it to us. \u201cAs late as the 1960s, even the \u201870s, we still got certificates calling us <i>ajaat</i>. Now, schools and colleges say they've never heard of us and won't give our children admission.\u201d The surviving <i>ajaat</i> are not doing too well. Shyam and Prabhu just about make ends meet as petty agricultural traders.</p> <p class=\"body\">Forgotten by the late \u201870s, the <i>ajaat</i> were re-discovered some years ago by Nagpur journalists Atul Pandey and Jaideep Hardikar who wrote about their plight in Marathi and English respectively. Their reports sparked a Maharashtra government move to help them. But that died with the exit of the one senior official who had shown interest in the matter.</p> <p class=\"body\"><i>Ajaat</i> candidates can't contest panchayat polls. Poll officials refuse to accept their forms \u2014 which state no caste. \u201c<i>Ajaat</i> folk can't get ration cards without a huge struggle,\u201d says Prabhu. College admissions, scholarships and government jobs elude them for the same reasons. Other villagers won't marry into these families now as their caste status lacks clarity. In short, the followers of a once proud anti-caste reform movement have been reduced to a couple of thousand people viewed as something like a caste themselves.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cMy niece Sunaina could not get into college,\u201d says Prabhu. \u201cThe college said: \u2018we don't recognise this <i>ajaat.</i> Bring us a proper caste certificate and we'll admit her'.\u201d His nephew Manoj who did finally make it to college says: \u201cThey treat us as an oddity there. There were no scholarships for any of us. No one there believes such a thing as <i>ajaat</i> exists.\u201d A restless younger generation feels imprisoned by the past. Many of the <i>ajaat</i>, including Prabhu's family, have faced the ignominy of having to trace out an ancestor whose caste could be clearly proven.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cImagine our humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to take out caste certificates for our children.\u201d Not easy, given the generations of inter-caste marriages these families have seen. And even the ledger of the village kotwal lists them as \u2018<i>ajaat</i>.' Some have had to trace a great grandfather whose caste could be established. \u201cTo recover and rebuild those old records is a horrible job,\u201d says Prabhu. \u201cThe authorities suspect us of concealing things and faking our caste. And it hurts us like anything to make these caste certificates. But without them our children are truly stuck.\u201d Sadly, they had no choice but to trace out the caste origin of anti-caste crusader Ganpati Maharaj himself. That was needed for his great-grandchildren.</p> <p class=\"body\">Quite a few of the remaining 2,000 or so <i>ajaat</i> gather at that centre in this village in November each year. \u201cNow there is only one such family we have contact with in Madhya Pradesh,\u201d says a glum Prabhu. The rest are in Maharashtra. \u201cOnly 105 are formally registered with our body, the <i>ajaatiya maanav sanstha</i>. But far more than that come to our annual meeting. However, consider that we once had 60,000 members in this movement.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWe need a much more comprehensive survey of caste than the mere introduction of a question in the Census will permit,\u201d says economist Dr. K. Nagaraj (formerly with the Madras Institute of Development Studies) who has worked on the subject. \u201cThat we need caste data is beyond doubt. But we need that data in a frame that captures the huge diversity, location-specific nature, and the many other complexities of caste. A single question in the 2011 census will not achieve that. This is perhaps a job for the National Sample Survey and its team of trained investigators with much advance preparation.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">So what happens if that enumerator does come around to your house with the question on caste? \u201cBelieve me,\u201d says Prabhu, \u201cIt will confuse him. I think they should create a different category in the Census for people like us. We must declare who we are. We have fought against everything that stands for caste. But in this society, caste is in everything.\u201d</p>", "date": "June 4, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article445810.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Social reform", "anti-caste movement", "Ajaat"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["'Never let school interfere with your education'"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">\u201cFreedom from fear\u201d and \u201cPunishment-free zone\u201d read the slogans on the school walls. These signify the end of corporal punishment. They take on a different meaning, though, when schools are occupied by the police, as they are around Dhinkia and Govindpur, the villages resisting the State's takeover of their farmland for Posco's mega power and steel project (<i>The Hindu</i>, July 13-14).</p> <p class=\"body\">Children here grabbed national attention when they joined their parents in the protests against the forcible land acquisition. And still more when the fall in school attendance drew the wrath of Orissa's Women and Child Development Minister Anjali Behera. Her concern that children remain in school is unexceptionable. Her belief that they were not there only because they had joined the protests is misplaced.</p> <p class=\"body\">In this State, millions remaining in the classrooms are unlikely to get an education. Besides, Orissa has \u201cnot served midday meals in most schools since mid-June,\u201d says Biraj Patnaik, Adviser to the Supreme Court's Food Commissioners. \u201cAnd they are sitting on over Rs.146 crore of last year's disbursement for the scheme from the Central government.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">But back to the villages. \u201cFour of our six rooms are occupied by the police who are here to deal with the agitation,\u201d says a teacher at the Balia nodal Upper Primary School. This school runs till to Class 7. \u201cEvery morning, all the children assemble, we take attendance \u2014 and then dismiss Classes 1-5. How to teach them?\u201d The police occupy space in several schools. They have vacated one in Balituth but remain in at least four others including Balia.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cIn school,\u201d says angry 10-year-old Rakesh Bardhan in Govindpur, \u201cthey teach us the story of Baji Rout.\u201d A 13-year-old boatman and legendary Oriya hero shot dead by the British when he refused to ferry them across a river in pursuit of freedom fighters. \u201cThey tell us, \u2018you should emulate Baji Rout and the way he stood up for his homeland.' But when we stand up for ours, they react badly.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">How do their teachers feel about this? Bishwambar Mohanty, aged 14, scoffs: \u201cWhat can they say? They know that if we lose our land and village \u2014 there will be no school either.\u201d One teacher says: \u201cThey have seen police fire rubber bullets on their parents. They've seen their betel vineyards and their homes destroyed. And said that all this is good for Orissa's development. How else can they react?\u201d Another student asks: \u201cThey are turning their guns on our parents and they want us to remain in school?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">A team of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights came here, concerned by the \u201cmisuse\u201d of the children in the protests. At the end of their visit, while asking the protestors to keep children out, the team also called on the government \u201cto withdraw police forces sheltered in schools meant for the education of children.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cIf the government orders us, obviously we will find other shelters,\u201d Jagatsinghpur District Superintendent of Police S. Devdutt Singh told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, teachers have been given the additional task of talking to the parents of \u201cabsentees.\u201d \u201cThe BDO demands a daily report on attendance and how many parents we have met,\u201d a teacher grumbles. \u201cAs if we don't have enough paperwork already, \u2018with 74 records to keep updated'.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Govindpur Upper Primary School has 240 students and four teachers. Of these, only one is a regular teacher. The others are <i>shiksha sahayaks</i> (\u201cassistant teachers\u201d) and <i>gana sikhyak</i> (\u201cmass educator\u201d). Last month the State recruited 20,000 <i>shiksha sahayaks</i> to fill vacancies amongst regular teachers. Many <i>sahayaks </i>are poorly-trained and ill-equipped to teach. In the panchayat of the Posco area, there are only \u201cacting headmasters.\u201d In many schools across the State, the headmaster's post remains vacant for years. There are also 29,000 vacancies for primary school teachers in Orissa. \u201cThey'd have to pay more if they filled those up properly,\u201d grins one teacher. In Tirlochanpur village, 400 students go to a school without a single regular teacher.</p> <p class=\"body\">Shorn of the jargon offered under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, this amounts to recruiting \u201cteachers\u201d at pathetic salaries. <i>Shiksha sahayaks </i>get a consolidated Rs.4,000. If they last six years, they <i>might </i>be absorbed as zilla parishad teachers. The \u201c<i>gana sikhyak</i>\u201d (\u201cvolunteer teachers\u201d under the Education Guarantee Scheme) is worse off. \u201cThey are least qualified and shouldn't be teaching, but they are,\u201d says an official. They earn Rs.2,250 to Rs.2,500 a month. Less than what a landless labourer earns in 30 days of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) work. Spending less by paying \u201cteachers\u201d a pittance has helped gut the system. \u201cWhy will qualified people join this profession now?\u201d asks one.</p> <p class=\"body\">The poor quality breeds, as across the country, a huge private tuition industry. Some teachers earn more from tuitions. Others are not qualified to do even that. Some don't teach at all. And there's a welter of other problems.

{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["How to be an \u2018eligible suicide\u2019"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Kafka might have envied the script. In Delhi, Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar informed the Rajya Sabha on May 7 that there had been just six farmers' suicides in Vidarbha since January. The same day, same time in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said that figure was 343. That is, 57 times greater than Mr. Pawar's count. Mr. Chavan was speaking in Vidarbha. Mr. Pawar's numbers came in a written reply to a question in Parliament. Both stories were reported by the Press Trust of India (PTI). All in a day's work.</p> <p class=\"body\">Confused? Try this: Five days earlier, Minister of State for Agriculture K.V. Thomas pitched his count at 23 suicides in Vidarbha since January. In the same week \u2014 in the same Rajya Sabha. And Mr. Thomas said his source was \u201cthe government of Maharashtra.\u201d Whose chief minister says the number is 343. Meanwhile, before Mr. Pawar gave the figure of 'only six' in four months, the government's Vasantrao Naik Farmers' Self Reliance Mission in Vidarbha put the number at 62 for just January alone.</p> <p class=\"body\">Can estimates of farm suicides \u2014 all of them official \u2014 vary by over 5,500 per cent? (Mr. Chavan's is that much higher than Mr. Pawar's). But it doesn't end there. Maharashtra Revenue Minister Narayan Rane informed the State Assembly in April that there have been 5,574 suicides in Vidarbha since 2006. But Parliament is told only six have occurred since January this year. Mr. Rane's count for the whole state since 2006 is 7,786 farm suicides. <i>That is more than double Mr. Pawar's new count of 3,450 for the whole country in the last three years</i>.</p> <p class=\"body\">That's odd \u2014 3,450 for the whole country? In three years? The National Crime Records Bureau puts the number in the last three years at nearly 50,000. That is for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (the last year for which data are available). And the NCRB is the only source for farm suicide data at the national level. Its data also show us that nearly 200,000 farmers have killed themselves between 1997 and 2008. So whose numbers are being fed to Parliament? And how come we have so many wildly varying counts? That too when there is only one body with authentic data. And why does this happen mostly with Maharashtra?</p> <p class=\"body\">Because Maharashtra's numbers are the worst in the country. This state has seen 41,404 farmers' suicides since 1997. Of these, 12,493 have occurred in 2006-08. So the pressure to cover up is greater here than anywhere else.</p> <p class=\"body\">The concern was never about the farmer. Till the Prime Minister's 2006 Vidarbha visit, the state's top ministers had never been to a distress-hit village on this issue. Most have still not visited a single suicide-hit farm household. They cared little for what people thought of them. But they did fear the displeasure of their own high command in New Delhi \u2014 by then alarmed at the rising suicide numbers. So they began massaging the figures.</p> <p class=\"body\">First, this meant attaching an impossible number of indicators to identify a farm suicide. As early as June 2005, people in Malwagad, Yavatmal were mocking the process when we arrived there after the suicide of Digambar Agose. \u201cNow we can't even commit suicide in peace,\u201d laughed one of Agose's neighbours with graveyard humour. \u201cNot without reading those forms the officials have created to see we get it right.\u201d Another pointed out: \u201cThere are some 40 clauses on their inquiry list. All these must apply.\u201d In short, if you must kill yourself, get it right. Make sure you adhere to the <i>pro forma</i>. Then your family is \u2018eligible' for compensation.</p> <p class=\"body\">Hundreds of people were dropped from the farm suicide lists on the ground that they were not farmers. \u201cThere's no land in their names,\u201d officials asserted. On the ground, this meant most women farmers taking their lives were excluded. As also, many eldest sons who actually ran the farm while the land remained in their aged fathers' names. The lists also shut out many dalit and adivasi peasants \u2014 whose title to land is seldom clear.</p> <p class=\"body\">And yet the numbers kept mounting. The reporting of the issue was hurting where it mattered: in Delhi. So how to bring down the count? Ambitious bureaucrats stepped forward to create new categories. 'Eligible' and 'ineligible' suicides. Only the former would be counted as \u201cfarm suicides.\u201d An official document set this trend in 2006.</p> <p class=\"body\">It created a table with many new columns. With each of these, the numbers fell. How? After the total or farm suicides, came a new group: \u201cFamily members' suicides.\u201d This means family members on the farm killing themselves are not counted as farmers. That helped skim down the figure still more. Next, an \u201cInvestigated Cases\u201d column that saw numbers plummet further. The final column was truly novel \u2014 \u201cEligible Suicides.\u201d That is, those the government deems worthy of compensation. And so, for 2005, the suicides column that begins at 2,425 ends with 273. (Less than 12 per cent of the total). This amputated figure becomes the official farm suicides count. And a \u2018decline' is established.</p> <p class=\"body\">And so the coming of \u2018non-genuine suicides.' This did not mean the man was any less dead. Or that he had not killed himself. It meant the government could not accept his death had been driven by debt and distress. (Even though quite a few suicide notes cited precisely those reasons.) Committees were set up in the crisis districts to check if the suicides were \u2018genuine.' These bodies soon ran berserk, often declaring every single suicide in a month to be \u2018non-genuine.' Their hatchet job means that very few families suffering a breadwinner's suicide get any compensation from government.</p> <p class=\"body\">And that's how it's still done. Mr. Rane's reply to a question in the state assembly lists <i>thousands</i> of \u2018ineligible suicides' over four years.</p> <p class=\"body\">The problem of the NCRB's data however, remains. These are not in their hands to fudge. Sure, over time, even the NCRB's data will be corrupted by the fiddles at the ground level. But it is the here and now of politics that matters. The only way to get around this is to simply ignore the NCRB. So the Minister's written reply in Parliament makes no mention of it. You can see the change from the past.</p> <p class=\"body\">NCRB data was precisely what he cited in 2007 when confirming there had been nearly 1.5 lakh farm suicides between 1997 and 2005. Replying to Starred Question No. 238 in the Rajya Sabha (Nov. 30, 2007), Mr. Pawar's numbers tallied to the last digit with those reported in <i>The Hindu</i> (Nov.12-17) two weeks earlier. <i>The Hindu</i>'s reports were based on the comprehensive study of official data on farm suicides by Professor K. Nagaraj, then with the Madras Institute of Development Studies. The data analysed by him were from the NCRB. It publishes these in its Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI) report each year. A part of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, the NCRB is the only body that exists, which tracks suicides of all categories across the country.</p> <p class=\"body\">Following Dr. Nagaraj's study, <i>The Hindu</i> updated the farm suicide figures each year, drawing from the latest NCRB reports. (All these reports are available on their website. For instance, the 2008 data in the category of \u201cSelf Employed (Farming / Agriculture)\u201d counts farmers' suicides for that year as <i>16,196</i>. (Check it yourselves on http://ncrb.nic.in/ADSI2008/table-2.11.pdf ). But in Mr. Pawar's Rajya Sabha reply this May, that figure is 1,237 (no source cited. At least not in the PTI report). To date, neither central nor state government has ever contradicted the NCRB-based figures of Dr. Nagaraj and <i>The Hindu</i>. They're too busy contradicting their own.</p> <p class=\"body\">Simply put, governments are doing the same things they do with poverty estimates. With BPL counts, APL numbers, ration cards and so on. With farm suicides \u2014 real human deaths are involved. The pressure to fudge gets more acute with public revulsion over the plight of farmers.</p> <p class=\"body\">Yet, the 2011 Census could make things look a lot worse. It will tell us how many farmers there really are now in each state. In states like Maharashtra, they are likely to be far fewer than they were in 2001. (The 2001 Census showed that 8 million people had quit farming since 1991). Till today, all the Farm Suicide Rates (suicides per 100,000 farmers) worked out by Dr. Nagaraj are based on 2001 figures. The FSR for Maharashtra, for instance, is 29.9. That could look a lot worse \u2014 and the suicides far more intense \u2014 when the new Census figures on farmers are out. But the fiddles and fudging will go on.</p>", "date": "May 13, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article428367.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["suicides", "farmers"]}
{"title": ["Cowed down by the Prime Minister"], "author": ["Sainath"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Mandwa is still trying to recover from the Prime Minister's relief package. This Adivasi village (population: 550) got 36 hybrid cows under Manmohan Singh's 2006 programme to help Vidarbha's struggling farmers at the height of their crisis. The cows (and sometimes buffaloes) did not come free. \u201cWe paid Rs.4,500 and the government Rs.13,500 for each cow [a 75-per-cent subsidy],\u201d says Devidas Kishtareddy Gangulwar in the village. \u201cMost of the members of our [all-male] self-help groups got two cows. Meaning each paid Rs.9,000\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Four years after the hybrids (cutely called<i>aadha</i>Jerseys, or half-Jerseys) came to Mandwa, the village has paid the price. Of the 36, 20 have died, 12 were sold off at huge losses to the \u201cowner-beneficiaries\u201d and four remain, ornaments providing little or no milk at all. But not before twenty poor Kolam and Gond Adivasis had lost close to Rs.3,00,000 on them by way of their share of the purchase cost, transportation and maintenance.</p> <p class=\"body\">It's a story replicated across the crisis districts of a region plagued by large numbers of farm suicides. In a modestly titled section, \u201cUnfruitful subsidy under Prime minister's Package\u201d, a Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) notes that a scrutiny in just three of the six crisis districts proved startling. It showed that \u201c509 animals were dead, 473 were sold and 1867 could not be verified\u201d as still being with the stated owner. That's nearly 28 per cent of \u201c10,210 animals distributed during the package period\u201d of 2006-07 to 2009-10.</p> <p class=\"body\">Then there's the \u201cunfruitful subsidy\u201d on the same count arising from the \u201cChief Minister's Package.\u201d That, too, saw a distribution of over 6,000 milch animals in the same districts. The score: 466 animals dead, 517 sold and 1266 \u201cnon-traceable.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The Chief Minister's package was merged in November 2006 with the Prime Minister's. Many warned at the time against giving costly cattle to poor farmers who had neither fodder nor water. Nor was there training for people who had never been cattle breeders, as in Mandwa's case. Yet, over Rs.50 crore was splurged on the purchase of livestock.</p> <p class=\"body\">There is not one working hand pump in Mandwa. \u201cWe fetch our water from more than a kilometre away,\u201d says Mr. Gangulwar, just as a cart rolls in with a big drum of it. \u201cFodder? Just go out and try buying some.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWhile the cows lasted, we spent far more on them than we could afford,\u201d says Ayya Baheru Atram. Breeders say looking after such animals properly takes between Rs.150 and Rs.200 a day. \u201cWhich one of us could spend more than Rs.40?\u201d asks Sonerao Meshram, another beneficiary. \u201cAnd that, only for a few months till we went bankrupt.\u201d Mr. Sonerao is the proud owner of one of the four survivors and all gather round it for a group photograph.</p> <p class=\"body\">Frequent ailments plagued the hybrid animals (a few were \u201c<i>aadha</i>Holsteins\u201d) which simply could not cope with conditions in this hillside village. \u201cThey were shaking in the 45 Celsius heat,\u201d says Devidas Gangulwar. \u201cWe had to take them often to the veterinary doctor,\u201d say a chorus of voices. Ultimately, \u201cthe vet's income went up, ours went down.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">But surely, there were benefits from the sale of milk? There are rueful smiles. \u201cThe milk was very thin and there were no takers,\u201d says Shyamrao Ramulu Akulwar. \u201cThe first month, the cows actually gave eight litres a day. But there were no buyers and the market is pretty far off, too. So we had a brief glut of milk here.\u201d Most had really hoped they would get sturdy bullocks from the offspring. This is a rough terrain to plough. The manure would also have helped. \u201cAs we ran out of money and stopped feeding them even that Rs.40 worth, they stopped giving us even that thin milk,\u201d says Mr. Shyamrao.</p> <p class=\"body\">Ayya Atram \u201cheld on to the cow for two years but the milk lasted four months.\u201d Its required diet missing, the cow shrank and the one calf it produced died. We could have, the Adivasis say, \u201chandled local breeds. These animals were aliens to us.\u201d They could also have handled poultry well, but were never told of the option. Somebody had cows to sell.</p> <p class=\"body\">There's a drama behind the Prime Minister's missing cows, and the ones that were sold-off. One the CAG report obviously cannot enter. And not restricted to Mandwa. The beneficiaries did not profit from what turned out to be high-eating low-yielding cows. \u201cWe sold when the damn things drove us bankrupt,\u201d complains one villager. Those who sold, got a fraction of the Rs.9,000 they had spent. Others failed to sell before the animals died, losing out totally. In several villages, people simply gave the animal away, unable to feed it, unwilling to kill it. And, says one activist in the region, \u201ca few were consumed in one or two hungry villages.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">There is also a less recorded drama of where the cows came from and how the programmes set the cash registers ringing somewhere. Some of the<i>aadha</i>Jerseys and half-Holsteins, insist activists, were from Ahmednagar district. A couple of dealers in Vidarbha also seem to have made a killing. Mandwa's beneficiaries were taken to a cattle sale in Wardha and asked to choose from a specific dealer there. They also paid all the considerable transportation costs themselves.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, the package has wound up. Mandwa now seeks relief from the package's effects.</p> <p class=\"body\"><i><b></b></i></p> <p class=\"body\">Four years after hybrid cattle came to Mandwa under the Prime Minister's relief programme, the village has paid the price.</p>", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article2014092.ece"], "location": "\n", "date": "May 13, 2011"}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["The winter of our austerity "], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Corporate Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid\u2019s call for restraint, however mild, on the CEO feeding frenzy at the compensation trough, seems the least objectionable statement made by a Minister in months. (Contrast this, for example, with the Agriculture Minister\u2019s warning that people should accept a further rise in food prices and blame it on drought. Or with a senior member of the Union Cabinet grumbling about the Prime Minister\u2019s austerity drive. How much money will it save if we give up first class air travel, he wanted to know.) But Mr. Khurshid\u2019s words were enough to spook the captains of industry into whines of protest which will steadily get stronger.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWe can hardly say we will shut our eyes to the salaries the CEOs are going to take,\u201d said Mr. Khurshid, hoping that companies would refrain from handing out vulgar salaries. An equally mild wish expressed by the Prime Minister in 2007 saw the media come down on Manmohan Singh like they never had before. \u201cThe Prime Minister wants CEOs to create wealth for the nation. Then he wants them to take pay cuts.\u201d That was a slogan put up by a Mumbai newspaper on huge hoardings. </p> <p class=\"body\">This time, the media were slow off the blocks in going after Mr. Khurshid. After all, between Dr. Singh\u2019s faux pas and Mr. Khurshid\u2019s mild protest was a Great Recession. And to say \u201cthe Market will decide\u201d isn\u2019t enough, any more. In 2008, the Market decided to jump off a cliff taking much of the world with it. That didn\u2019t stop CEOs in the United States from taking home billions in bonuses in a year they ran the globe into the ground. In fact, more CEOs got hikes rather than cuts in 2008, as an AFL-CIO study pointed out in April this year. In India, while millions lost their jobs and livelihoods, CEOs didn\u2019t fare too badly. (How can they, in a country where the Union budget alone gives the corporate world subsidies of Rs.700 crore every day in tax write-offs and concessions? See The Hindu, August 15, 2009). It wasn\u2019t the market which decided that $6 million of public money be gifted to the corporate sector each hour on average, it was the government. The government can though, with few qualms, cap the daily wage paid to hungry workers at NREG sites at Rs.100. That, for 100 days only \u2014 and those days to be shared by the members of each household. </p> <p class=\"body\">So the clich\u00e9s of the Market lack that warm, righteous glow they had before the meltdown. But as big business re-asserts itself, the media will find their voice. Mr. Khurshid is about to find out whose voice that is, loud and clear, if he didn\u2019t already know. And he surely knows the power of corporate links to large sections of the political class. The two highest-paid CEOs in the country managed to save Dr. Singh\u2019s previous government from falling in the July 2008 trust vote. And only recently, much of a whole session of Parliament went to discussing the fight between the same two CEOs. Mr. Khurshid\u2019s comments, however, at least make for a debate on \u2018austerity,\u2019 its practice by the political class and big business \u2014 and the ever-closer bonding between the two.</p> <p class=\"body\">Growing numbers of elected representatives fund their poll campaigns with corporate backing. And growing numbers of people with a big business background have ventured directly into the electoral arena. The links get stronger, the reps get richer. And there is much entrepreneurial joy and success. </p> <p class=\"body\">While the CEOs top the charts by miles, the vulgarity Mr. Khurshid fears also consumes much of the political class. Take for instance, the 42 MLAs re-contesting this time in Haryana\u2019s polls. On average, their assets have increased by around Rs.48 million each since 2004. A nice 388 per cent leap. That is to say, each of them added Rs.800,000 a month to their wealth in their last term. Or over Rs.1,100 for every hour that they were MLAs (for five years). A healthy rate of growth. Maybe we need a constitutional amendment requiring every Indian to serve as MLA for one term at least. It could be the biggest poverty reduction programme ever undertaken. (I mean across all States. It might be slightly chaotic if every citizen was required to be a member of the Haryana Assembly.) </p> <p class=\"body\">These and other fascinating insights abound in the reports put out by the National Election Watch on the Assembly polls in three States. (October 13 is the voting day.) NEW is a coalition of over 1,200 civil society groups across the country that also brought out excellent reports on these issues at the time of the Lok Sabha polls in April-May. Its effort to bring such data to the voting public is spearheaded by the NGO, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).</p> <p class=\"body\">Those who won the last time and seek re-election have led by example. The 388 per cent rise in assets per MLA in Haryana is but an average. Break it up and you find some stirring success stories. The top four MLAs clocking the best growth rates, all of them from the Congress, saw their assets increase by over 800 per cent. Imagine what they might have achieved had there been no austerity drive. The numero uno in this list has a rags to riches story. Starting from humble beginnings of less than a lakh, his wealth has risen 5,000 per cent. Inspiring. And perhaps one of the reasons \u2014 together with a love of democracy \u2014 why far more have been inspired to contest this time in this State than five years ago. The number of candidates is 20 per cent higher than it was in 2004. </p> <p class=\"body\">Of 489 contestants whose poll affidavits NEW was able to study, 251 \u2014 51 per cent, or every second candidate \u2014 was worth well over Rs.10 million. Though it must be conceded that those at the lower end of the crorepati chain see their assets swollen by crazy real estate rates. And as yet, these are just candidates. The crorepati ratio will go up after the results, when much of the plebeian element gets weeded out. This is not to say the austerity school has no following in Haryana. Some candidates have declared stunningly low assets. A couple of them say they\u2019re worth less than Rs.3,000 and one, poor lamb, has declared zero assets of any kind. </p> <p class=\"body\">In Maharashtra, compared to 2004, there has been a 60 per cent increase in political parties contesting elections. Also, a 33 per cent increase in candidates. NEW has thus far studied the affidavits of 880 of over 3,500 candidates seeking election to the State legislature. It found that almost one in every four candidates is a multi-millionaire. (Here too, though, there are a daring few claiming zero assets.) NEW has so far seen less than a third of candidate affidavits \u2014 and already located 212 crorepatis. Over half of these are from the four major parties, with the Congress (42) heading the austere list. The BJP, the Shiv Sena and the NCP all have 29 each among candidates surveyed. The MNS (21) and the BSP (11) don\u2019t do too badly either. All these numbers will swell when all their affidavits are studied. </p> <p class=\"body\">Around 52 per cent of Haryana\u2019s 90 sitting MLAs were multi-millionaires. That beats rich Maharashtra where just over one in three (37 per cent) makes the cut. But Maharashtra outclasses Haryana in the number of sitting MLAs with pending criminal records: 45 per cent to 31 per cent. (It might be worthwhile for NEW to correlate criminal records with crorepati status. Even if that takes more time).</p> <p class=\"body\">And finally, there are those who get elected to serve the CEO cause, bringing us back to the political class-corporate nexus. The present government of Maharashtra, for instance, has handed over 5 airports (including 601 hectares of land) for Rs.63 crore to a single corporation, as Imtiaz Jaleel\u2019s excellent report on NDTV shows. A price so low that even most of the State government\u2019s own departments opposed it. It would likely be difficult to get 601 hectares in the desert for that sum. The government\u2019s brilliant defence is that it has not privatised an inch \u2014 just leased out the airports. Yup, for 95 years for that pittance, to the Anil Ambani group. Work out the math yourselves. I hope it doesn\u2019t get any more austere than this, though.</p>", "date": "October 8, 2009", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article30456.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Salman Khurshid", "CEO salary", "pay cut", "austerity", "'vulgar' salary", "political parties", "corporate companies"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["Kerala won't be quite the same again"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">A single issue dogs all candidates in the local polls in Guruvayoor municipality of Kerala's Thrissur district. Any of the temple town's 80,000 voters, regardless of party affiliation, will brief you on the problem. Which has devastated the backwaters, rendered local fishermen jobless, poses massive health hazards and left residents helpless.</p> <p class=\"body\">That issue is, say three people (including two candidates) at the same time: \u201cThe hotel lobby is too powerful. There are 150-200 lodges and hotels here, big and small, and most do no waste treatment at all. They have no septic tanks, will not install them and simply ignore orders to do so. With lakhs of tourists coming each year to the temple in this small place, the mess gets worse.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cHuman waste now clogs two of 14 km of backwaters in our stretch,\u201d says C.F. George, a teacher and independent activist. \u201cIt is pumped through an open canal which merges into the backwater, completely polluting it. The tourists who come here are unaware of what the locals face. But this tourism is also Guruvayoor's only industry and main source of revenue. It has become unliveable along the backwaters. The fishermen are finished and no one there buys fish anymore.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">K.A. Sreedharan of the UDF (Congress) sounds helpless: \u201cI am convinced change is needed, just not sure it will happen. Both the UDF and the LDF say hotels must dispose of the waste. They never do. The hotel crowd are too powerful at higher levels.\u201d The \u201clocal bodies ombudsman says Guruvayoor needs a new master plan,\u201d says George. \u201cBut the parties only talk of a waste treatment plant which is not enough to tackle this.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Activism has sprung up around such issues, though. And against the backdrop of polls that will bring thousands of new candidates to office. Including women who will account for over 50 per cent of all 21, 682 wards in the 1,209 local bodies going to the polls. This will change the face of Kerala's pollscape. \u201cIt will bring an element of freshness,\u201d says T.A. Usha Kumari, writer and trade union activist in Thrissur. \u201cWithout reservations, there would be no large induction of women. Even though they have proved their abilities already in the local bodies.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In Guruvayoor, candidates like Latha Radhakrishnan, Dhanya Biju, Suma Narayanan and Geeta Sashidharan of the LDF agree, saying they have little to prove. \u201cWe have all been in women's organisations for years and also with \u2018Kudumbashree' (Kerala's anti-poverty programme). Women voters identify with us. We walk into their kitchens and families.\u201d Their confidence is high. However, Guruvayoor's problem is a harder one for women or men alike. This will not be a \u2018clean-the-mess' task that \u2018Kudumbashree'-background women often face, but a nasty minefield. Even more complex are the larger, new political challenges facing women.</p> <p class=\"body\">The authors of a paper on \u201cEmpowerment or politicisation?\u201d argue that \u201cwomen's entry into local governance cannot be equated with their becoming full agents in the domain of politics.\u201d J. Devika and Binitha V. Thampi of the Centre for Development Studies, Kerala, say women's chances of entry into politics, \u201care a distinct issue not to be lumped with their presence in local government.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">One concern is that women may be (and see themselves as) a service-oriented force within panchayats. As \u201cfair distributors of welfare benefits\u201d rather than as political actors in their own right. They show that (prior to these polls) the percentage of women in senior posts (such as chairpersons of standing committees) fell as you moved from village to district-level panchayats. And that many women panchayat members gained entry in ways that were themselves limiting in political terms.</p> <p class=\"body\">Will the reservations, which now cover senior posts, change this? In numbers, in governance, certainly. In other dimensions, the \u2018Kudumbashree' process has achieved much. In politics, the question is, as the authors argue, far more complex. Even where women have been unionised or taken part in political protests and action in large numbers, they have rarely held posts of political authority in Kerala. In fact, at the top, they've been mostly excluded.</p> <p class=\"body\">There are, though, processes at play that could alter some things. A sense that big changes are under way. The Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) is gearing itself up for unusual post-poll training exercises. With the Left having said \u2018no' to candidates with more than two terms in local bodies and the Congress also pushing youngsters, there will be thousands of new entrants this time. Yet, KILA's training is aimed at many besides them. For the first time: \u201cSensitisation training will cover spouses and male heads of the family,\u201d says KILA Director N. Ramakantan. \u201cWith the \u2018double burden' most of the women carry into office, there is a real need to build up support for them, including from their families. So while the elected women get vital training, there will also be a need to sensitise spouses, fathers and brothers on their responsibilities as well.\u201d (There have also been instances where corruption by a husband or father has damaged an honest panchayat member.)</p> <p class=\"body\">The acknowledgment of this need is in itself a step forward. A look at the campaign rubbed that home. In more than one place we visited, the way male campaign managers or activists organised the new women candidates was bad, their attitudes appalling. Male candidates are treated with far greater respect.</p> <p class=\"body\">Some things might have changed forever. Most, if not all the thousands of women in the poll fray are from hard core political families whether CPI-M or Congress. Hundreds of them will soon also be presidents or vice presidents of their panchayats. It will be impossible for any major political party to continue having less than 15-20 per cent of women candidates in the assembly polls as they have for decades. So whoever loses, Kerala wins.</p> <p class=\"body\">It's no accident that the only women MLAs today \u2014 just seven, all LDF \u2014 have all come out of local body backgrounds. When 10,000 women get elected at that level, the floodgates of aspiration are open. Also, the demand for \u2018tickets' will be coming from the bedrock base of all major parties, from families who make up their core support at the village level. Alienating them could prove costly. More so when the process has altered elections in the state forever. So a lot could depend on who shows better judgment on this in coming years \u2014 the LDF or the UDF.</p>", "date": "October 25, 2010", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article847189.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["waste treatment plant", "pollution", "women power", "Guruvayoor polls"]}
{"author": ["Sainath"], "title": ["A day at the vineyards"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Some of that legendary \u2018Banarasi pan' could have begun its journey from Gujjari Mohanty's vineyard in Govindpur, Orissa. \u201cI've sold our leaves in Benares [Varanasi] myself,\u201d says her son Sanatan. As have many of their neighbours. \u201cOur leaves are high-quality and greatly valued.\u201d The betel leaf, though, is not just about pan. It is also valued for medicinal qualities as a digestive, for the antiseptic nature of its oil, and its use along with arecanut for treating different ailments under Ayurveda.</p> <p class=\"body\">The vineyard is tiny, just a tenth of an acre (roughly 4,300 square feet). Multiple rows of bamboo and other sticks eight feet tall hold up, in all, hundreds of metres of betel vine (<i>Piper betle</i>). The vineyard is fenced off with bamboo also carrying other creepers. And a thin thatch of casuarina and coconut leaves cover the top. Casuarina leaves offer only a light shade and so make ideal \u201croofing\u201d \u2014 since some degree of sunlight is also vital. The rows are inches apart and you have to walk sideways to cross one. It's expertly organised and feels like a pleasantly air-conditioned room.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThe work is skilled but not strenuous,\u201d says Gujjari Mohanty who, past 70, handles it easily. It requires frequent but light irrigation. \u201cIt needs attention every day for brief periods,\u201d says a neighbour. \u201cBut even a weak, older person can do much of this.\u201d Some chores, though, are tougher and command twice the daily wage rate of Rs.200. In official count, Posco's project zone holds around 1,800 betel farms. Farmers here say 2,500. These vineyards would die if the farmland here were acquired for Posco's Rs.52,000-crore power and steel project. The government insists the betel farms are on forest land. The villagers, who have occupied this land for well over 80 years, demand their rights over it be recognised under the Forest Rights Act of 2006.</p> <p class=\"body\">Betel farmers in Dhinkia and Govindpur villages, home to the largest number of vineyards, are resisting the takeover of their land. \u201cWho is demanding jobs?\u201d asks Sanatan Mohanty. \u201cThere's only a demand for labour here. We pay the highest daily wage rate.\u201d Sanatan and Gujjari speak to us while tending the vineyard and while sorting the leaves at home into <i>kadas</i> (bundles of 50). In a year, they might harvest up to seven or eight lakh leaves, sometimes even 10 lakh, from this tenth of an acre. With over 2,000 farms, some of them bigger, that's a lot of leaves. And most of this is exported out of Orissa.</p> <p class=\"body\">With countless thousands of other betel farms in the State, the quantities exported are not small. Where once it all went to Benares, their produce now reaches Mumbai, Dhaka and Karachi. That's in a scenario where agriculture and forest products now account for just 0.01 per cent of Orissa's exports, according to the State's latest Economic Survey. (Mineral and metallurgical products make up over 80 per cent.) Oddly enough, the word \u2018Odisha,' which is the official name of the State, means \u201cland of farmers.\u201d But agriculture's share of GSDP is down to 18 per cent though well over 60 per cent of people depend on it. The communities here, along with other coastal folk, also have a share in Orissa's marine fish exports, already badly hit by Paradip port. Posco's planned captive port at Jatadhari would bury this sector.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cIn the first three quarters of the year we get two lakh leaves in each, in the last one around 1.2 lakh leaves,\u201d says Ranjan Swain, a betel farmer. \u201cThat lower yield is in the three winter months, but the quality improves and prices double in that period.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cFor the first six lakh leaves,\u201d points out Jagadish Pradhan of the Odisha Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (the Orissa village self-rule campaign), \u201cthey get Rs.450 per thousand leaves on average. That gives them around Rs.2.7 lakhs. For the remaining 1.2 lakh winter leaves they make a rupee a leaf. In all, a total of Rs.3.9 lakh.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The over 540 work days this produces in a year in 4,000 to 5,000 square feet means a labour cost of Rs.1.5 lakh, calculates Pradhan. The wage rate here at Rs.200 and higher is above what a construction worker in Bhubaneswar gets. But workers taking on tasks like lifting and tying of the creepers command up to Rs.500 a day. Those handling manure application, Rs.400. Workers doing earth filling and fencing claim Rs.350 a day. These tasks though last fewer days in a year. It means, however, that even landless workers are unenthusiastic about Posco's project.</p> <p class=\"body\">On average, the wage paid out is almost double the State's MNREGS rate of Rs.125. And it comes with a good meal. Then there are the costs on organic manure (oil cake), the wooden poles, bamboo pieces, rope wire, pump set maintenance. These add up to another Rs.50,000. \u201cThere are no transportation costs. The merchants pick them up from our doorstep in vans. There are a few other costs, but minor ones.\u201d (As in much of rural India, farmers never count their family labour as a cost). After a total expenditure of around Rs.2 lakhs, they're left with between Rs.1.5 to Rs.2 lakhs each year. \u201cAnd some of them,\u201d observes Pradhan, \u201chave more than one vineyard.\u201d Sanatan has four. Barring a brief period after the 1999 super-cyclone, several here have managed their farms largely without bank loans. </p> <p class=\"body\">On the three acres his family have apart from the vineyards, Sanatan has over 70 species of trees, plants, fruit and medicinal herbs. (He takes one yield of paddy from a limited patch for his family's consumption.) This too is a good source of income.</p> <p class=\"body\">Against this, the compensation the State is offering betel farms works out to Rs.1.15 lakh for a tenth of an acre farm like the one we're in now. \u201cImagine what we would lose,\u201d says Sanatan. A thought shared by thousands of others. \u201cAll this for a project that has a life of 30 years. And who will give us our prawns, our fish, our wind, our highly fertile lands, our weather and climate?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cI have spent nearly ten lakhs on educating my four children in the past several years. I am building a house that costs a little less than that. We don't need their compensation. We need our livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cDo they think we're idiots when they talk about jobs?\u201d asks Gujjari. \u201cEvery thing is getting mechanised. Who goes today to the post office, buys Rs.5 stamps, and sends letters when there are mobile phones?\u201d</p>", "date": "July 14, 2011", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article2224641.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["betel farms", "pan vineyards", "Posco"]}
