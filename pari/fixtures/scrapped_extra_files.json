{"title": ["Some States fight the trend but \u2026"], "author": ["P. Sainath"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The television story was genuine and sensitive. At least 90 farmers, it said, had committed suicide in two months in Andhra Pradesh. These were cotton growers. Actually, last year, Andhra farmers killed themselves at the rate of 210 each month on average, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. But it is heartening that somebody took note of what's going on. The more so when dishonest bureaucrats feed gullible sections of the press awful crud on farm suicides being at \u2018a 15-year low.' NCRB data show Andhra Pradesh has seen the\n<i>second worst increase</i>\nin farm suicides among all States (after Maharashtra) over the last eight years for which data exist.</p> <p class=\"body\">However, five States\n<i>did</i>\nmanage a significant decline in the average number of farm suicides each year between 2003 and 2010. Andhra Pradesh was not amongst them. Of those who did, only Karnataka is amongst the worst five States which account for nearly two-thirds of farm suicides in the country. On average, 2,259 farmers killed themselves each year in Karnataka between 1995 and 2002. In the next eight-year period, that figure was 2,123 \u2014 a fall of 136 in yearly average. But the fall is fragile, and the last two years 2009 and 2010 have seen the State's numbers rising again. And Karnataka remains the second worst State for farm suicides (in absolute numbers) after Maharashtra. It has seen 35,053 farmers kill themselves since 1995, according to the NCRB.</p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB data on farm suicides now cover 16 years. Let's divide that into two halves of eight years each. By comparing the first half (1995-2002) with the second (2003-10), we can figure out whether things are getting better or worse in the major States.</p> <p class=\"body\">What qualifies as a significant decline? That's when a State's yearly average in the second eight years is at least 100 farm suicides less than in the first eight-year period. Tamil Nadu (-126) and Uttar Pradesh (-109) are two others in this bracket. But there's better. Kerala managed a drop of 221. And West Bengal pulled off the biggest decline among all States. Its 2003-10 average is 436 lower than its figure for 1995-2002.</p> <p class=\"body\">Except Karnataka, all the Big 5 States show terrible upward spikes in their 2003-10 annual averages. The yearly average of farm suicides in Andhra Pradesh in this period was 711 higher than it was in 1995-02. In Maharashtra, the figure was 1,294 higher. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were one composite State for six of the 16 years and what has happened in that region is best understood by still treating them as one unit in terms of data. They show a rise of 525 in the second eight years.</p> <p class=\"body\">But comparing the two eight-year periods doesn't work for the smallest States with very few farm suicides. For instance, Manipur's average for 1995-2002 was one farm suicide. It was two during 2003-10, a massive \u2018increase' in percentage terms \u2014 and quite meaningless. However, among small States that have seen farm suicides, Tripura brought down its annual average by 90 in the second half, a drop of 78 per cent.</p> <p class=\"body\">The decline Kerala has managed (-221) is in many ways the most significant one. Kerala is perhaps India's most globalised economy. Its agriculture is hugely cash crop-based and fragile at the best of times. Cash crop prices are highly volatile, and often rigged by powerful corporations at the global level. This makes Kerala more vulnerable to price shocks than any other State in India. In the early years of the last decade, for instance, vanilla fetched Kerala farmers prices of up to Rs. 4,000 a kilogram. It then crashed to under Rs. 80 a kg or less (where it remains), wrecking farmers who had invested huge amounts of (borrowed) money in its cultivation. Most plunged into debt, several committed suicide in despair.</p> <p class=\"body\">Price shocks have also hit Kerala in coffee, pepper, and other cash crops into which the State is deeply locked. The price of coffee, for instance, is controlled by about four major global corporations. These companies always seek to drive down the share of the original producers to boost their own profits. They will do that even more strongly as economic problems mount in Europe \u2014 to where much of our coffee is exported. Across India, suicides amongst cash crop farmers are far higher than those amongst food crop growers. Cash crop farmers run far greater risks, incur much higher cultivation costs, and have to borrow a lot more money than their food crop-growing counterparts.</p> <p class=\"body\">So that drop of 221 in Kerala's yearly farm suicide average is remarkable and came against the odds. The period from 2008 to 2010 was better for that State than any other in the entire 16 years for which data are available. Kerala set up a debt relief tribunal in 2005, raised support to the farm sector and took other steps to mitigate distress. Even its troubled food crop sector received a boost. Between 2005 and 2010, Kerala doubled the support price for paddy from Rs. 700 to Rs.1,400. Yet, the State will take a worse hit than any other due to the multiple free trade agreements the Union government has signed or will enter. And reports of rising farm suicides again in the cash-crop citadel of Wayanad signal which way Kerala is now headed.</p> <p class=\"body\">West Bengal's (-436) drop in farm suicide yearly averages is perhaps best understood in comparison with Maharashtra. Bengal has a smaller population (91 million) than Maharashtra (112 million), but is a more rural State and has many more farmers. Yet, the annual averages are starkly different. During 2003-10, almost four times as many farmers (3,802) killed themselves each year in Maharashtra. In West Bengal that figure was 990. Though Bengal has its own sharp concentrations of cash crop, it produces more food crop than Maharashtra and has been the country's largest producer of rice for some years. In the latter, cash crops continue to overwhelm food crop. In 2010-11, as Maharashtra's Chief Minister informed his colleagues at a kharif review meeting earlier this year, the area under cereals and pulses dropped further by about 3.7 million acres. (\n<i>BusinessLine</i>\nMay 28, 2011). West Bengal had, in fact, begun procuring grain through the panchayats (a scheme derailed by the Centre) and pushed other measures to promote rice and vegetable cultivation.</p> <p class=\"body\">Overall, 15 of 28 States showed worse averages in the second eight years. Across the entire 16 years from 1995-2010, more than a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide.</p> <p class=\"body\"><i><b>\nFive States did manage a significant decline in the average number of farm suicides between 2003 and 2010.

{"title": ["Cowed down by the Prime Minister"], "author": ["P. Sainath"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Mandwa is still trying to recover from the Prime Minister's relief package. This Adivasi village (population: 550) got 36 hybrid cows under Manmohan Singh's 2006 programme to help Vidarbha's struggling farmers at the height of their crisis. The cows (and sometimes buffaloes) did not come free. \u201cWe paid Rs.4,500 and the government Rs.13,500 for each cow [a 75-per-cent subsidy],\u201d says Devidas Kishtareddy Gangulwar in the village. \u201cMost of the members of our [all-male] self-help groups got two cows. Meaning each paid Rs.9,000\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Four years after the hybrids (cutely called<i>aadha</i>Jerseys, or half-Jerseys) came to Mandwa, the village has paid the price. Of the 36, 20 have died, 12 were sold off at huge losses to the \u201cowner-beneficiaries\u201d and four remain, ornaments providing little or no milk at all. But not before twenty poor Kolam and Gond Adivasis had lost close to Rs.3,00,000 on them by way of their share of the purchase cost, transportation and maintenance.</p> <p class=\"body\">It's a story replicated across the crisis districts of a region plagued by large numbers of farm suicides. In a modestly titled section, \u201cUnfruitful subsidy under Prime minister's Package\u201d, a Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) notes that a scrutiny in just three of the six crisis districts proved startling. It showed that \u201c509 animals were dead, 473 were sold and 1867 could not be verified\u201d as still being with the stated owner. That's nearly 28 per cent of \u201c10,210 animals distributed during the package period\u201d of 2006-07 to 2009-10.</p> <p class=\"body\">Then there's the \u201cunfruitful subsidy\u201d on the same count arising from the \u201cChief Minister's Package.\u201d That, too, saw a distribution of over 6,000 milch animals in the same districts. The score: 466 animals dead, 517 sold and 1266 \u201cnon-traceable.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The Chief Minister's package was merged in November 2006 with the Prime Minister's. Many warned at the time against giving costly cattle to poor farmers who had neither fodder nor water. Nor was there training for people who had never been cattle breeders, as in Mandwa's case. Yet, over Rs.50 crore was splurged on the purchase of livestock.</p> <p class=\"body\">There is not one working hand pump in Mandwa. \u201cWe fetch our water from more than a kilometre away,\u201d says Mr. Gangulwar, just as a cart rolls in with a big drum of it. \u201cFodder? Just go out and try buying some.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWhile the cows lasted, we spent far more on them than we could afford,\u201d says Ayya Baheru Atram. Breeders say looking after such animals properly takes between Rs.150 and Rs.200 a day. \u201cWhich one of us could spend more than Rs.40?\u201d asks Sonerao Meshram, another beneficiary. \u201cAnd that, only for a few months till we went bankrupt.\u201d Mr. Sonerao is the proud owner of one of the four survivors and all gather round it for a group photograph.</p> <p class=\"body\">Frequent ailments plagued the hybrid animals (a few were \u201c<i>aadha</i>Holsteins\u201d) which simply could not cope with conditions in this hillside village. \u201cThey were shaking in the 45 Celsius heat,\u201d says Devidas Gangulwar. \u201cWe had to take them often to the veterinary doctor,\u201d say a chorus of voices. Ultimately, \u201cthe vet's income went up, ours went down.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">But surely, there were benefits from the sale of milk? There are rueful smiles. \u201cThe milk was very thin and there were no takers,\u201d says Shyamrao Ramulu Akulwar. \u201cThe first month, the cows actually gave eight litres a day. But there were no buyers and the market is pretty far off, too. So we had a brief glut of milk here.\u201d Most had really hoped they would get sturdy bullocks from the offspring. This is a rough terrain to plough. The manure would also have helped. \u201cAs we ran out of money and stopped feeding them even that Rs.40 worth, they stopped giving us even that thin milk,\u201d says Mr. Shyamrao.</p> <p class=\"body\">Ayya Atram \u201cheld on to the cow for two years but the milk lasted four months.\u201d Its required diet missing, the cow shrank and the one calf it produced died. We could have, the Adivasis say, \u201chandled local breeds. These animals were aliens to us.\u201d They could also have handled poultry well, but were never told of the option. Somebody had cows to sell.</p> <p class=\"body\">There's a drama behind the Prime Minister's missing cows, and the ones that were sold-off. One the CAG report obviously cannot enter. And not restricted to Mandwa. The beneficiaries did not profit from what turned out to be high-eating low-yielding cows. \u201cWe sold when the damn things drove us bankrupt,\u201d complains one villager. Those who sold, got a fraction of the Rs.9,000 they had spent. Others failed to sell before the animals died, losing out totally. In several villages, people simply gave the animal away, unable to feed it, unwilling to kill it. And, says one activist in the region, \u201ca few were consumed in one or two hungry villages.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">There is also a less recorded drama of where the cows came from and how the programmes set the cash registers ringing somewhere. Some of the<i>aadha</i>Jerseys and half-Holsteins, insist activists, were from Ahmednagar district. A couple of dealers in Vidarbha also seem to have made a killing. Mandwa's beneficiaries were taken to a cattle sale in Wardha and asked to choose from a specific dealer there. They also paid all the considerable transportation costs themselves.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, the package has wound up. Mandwa now seeks relief from the package's effects.</p> <p class=\"body\"><i><b></b></i></p> <p class=\"body\">Four years after hybrid cattle came to Mandwa under the Prime Minister's relief programme, the village has paid the price.</p>", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article2014092.ece"], "location": "\n", "date": "2011-05-13 00:00:00+00:00"}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["Kerala won't be quite the same again"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">A single issue dogs all candidates in the local polls in Guruvayoor municipality of Kerala's Thrissur district. Any of the temple town's 80,000 voters, regardless of party affiliation, will brief you on the problem. Which has devastated the backwaters, rendered local fishermen jobless, poses massive health hazards and left residents helpless.</p> <p class=\"body\">That issue is, say three people (including two candidates) at the same time: \u201cThe hotel lobby is too powerful. There are 150-200 lodges and hotels here, big and small, and most do no waste treatment at all. They have no septic tanks, will not install them and simply ignore orders to do so. With lakhs of tourists coming each year to the temple in this small place, the mess gets worse.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cHuman waste now clogs two of 14 km of backwaters in our stretch,\u201d says C.F. George, a teacher and independent activist. \u201cIt is pumped through an open canal which merges into the backwater, completely polluting it. The tourists who come here are unaware of what the locals face. But this tourism is also Guruvayoor's only industry and main source of revenue. It has become unliveable along the backwaters. The fishermen are finished and no one there buys fish anymore.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">K.A. Sreedharan of the UDF (Congress) sounds helpless: \u201cI am convinced change is needed, just not sure it will happen. Both the UDF and the LDF say hotels must dispose of the waste. They never do. The hotel crowd are too powerful at higher levels.\u201d The \u201clocal bodies ombudsman says Guruvayoor needs a new master plan,\u201d says George. \u201cBut the parties only talk of a waste treatment plant which is not enough to tackle this.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Activism has sprung up around such issues, though. And against the backdrop of polls that will bring thousands of new candidates to office. Including women who will account for over 50 per cent of all 21, 682 wards in the 1,209 local bodies going to the polls. This will change the face of Kerala's pollscape. \u201cIt will bring an element of freshness,\u201d says T.A. Usha Kumari, writer and trade union activist in Thrissur. \u201cWithout reservations, there would be no large induction of women. Even though they have proved their abilities already in the local bodies.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In Guruvayoor, candidates like Latha Radhakrishnan, Dhanya Biju, Suma Narayanan and Geeta Sashidharan of the LDF agree, saying they have little to prove. \u201cWe have all been in women's organisations for years and also with \u2018Kudumbashree' (Kerala's anti-poverty programme). Women voters identify with us. We walk into their kitchens and families.\u201d Their confidence is high. However, Guruvayoor's problem is a harder one for women or men alike. This will not be a \u2018clean-the-mess' task that \u2018Kudumbashree'-background women often face, but a nasty minefield. Even more complex are the larger, new political challenges facing women.</p> <p class=\"body\">The authors of a paper on \u201cEmpowerment or politicisation?\u201d argue that \u201cwomen's entry into local governance cannot be equated with their becoming full agents in the domain of politics.\u201d J. Devika and Binitha V. Thampi of the Centre for Development Studies, Kerala, say women's chances of entry into politics, \u201care a distinct issue not to be lumped with their presence in local government.\u201d </p> <p class=\"body\">One concern is that women may be (and see themselves as) a service-oriented force within panchayats. As \u201cfair distributors of welfare benefits\u201d rather than as political actors in their own right. They show that (prior to these polls) the percentage of women in senior posts (such as chairpersons of standing committees) fell as you moved from village to district-level panchayats. And that many women panchayat members gained entry in ways that were themselves limiting in political terms.</p> <p class=\"body\">Will the reservations, which now cover senior posts, change this? In numbers, in governance, certainly. In other dimensions, the \u2018Kudumbashree' process has achieved much. In politics, the question is, as the authors argue, far more complex. Even where women have been unionised or taken part in political protests and action in large numbers, they have rarely held posts of political authority in Kerala. In fact, at the top, they've been mostly excluded.</p> <p class=\"body\">There are, though, processes at play that could alter some things. A sense that big changes are under way. The Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) is gearing itself up for unusual post-poll training exercises. With the Left having said \u2018no' to candidates with more than two terms in local bodies and the Congress also pushing youngsters, there will be thousands of new entrants this time. Yet, KILA's training is aimed at many besides them. For the first time: \u201cSensitisation training will cover spouses and male heads of the family,\u201d says KILA Director N. Ramakantan. \u201cWith the \u2018double burden' most of the women carry into office, there is a real need to build up support for them, including from their families. So while the elected women get vital training, there will also be a need to sensitise spouses, fathers and brothers on their responsibilities as well.\u201d (There have also been instances where corruption by a husband or father has damaged an honest panchayat member.)</p> <p class=\"body\">The acknowledgment of this need is in itself a step forward. A look at the campaign rubbed that home. In more than one place we visited, the way male campaign managers or activists organised the new women candidates was bad, their attitudes appalling. Male candidates are treated with far greater respect.</p> <p class=\"body\">Some things might have changed forever. Most, if not all the thousands of women in the poll fray are from hard core political families whether CPI-M or Congress. Hundreds of them will soon also be presidents or vice presidents of their panchayats. It will be impossible for any major political party to continue having less than 15-20 per cent of women candidates in the assembly polls as they have for decades. So whoever loses, Kerala wins.</p> <p class=\"body\">It's no accident that the only women MLAs today \u2014 just seven, all LDF \u2014 have all come out of local body backgrounds. When 10,000 women get elected at that level, the floodgates of aspiration are open. Also, the demand for \u2018tickets' will be coming from the bedrock base of all major parties, from families who make up their core support at the village level. Alienating them could prove costly. More so when the process has altered elections in the state forever. So a lot could depend on who shows better judgment on this in coming years \u2014 the LDF or the UDF.</p>", "date": "2010-10-25 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article847189.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["waste treatment plant", "pollution", "women power", "Guruvayoor polls"]}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["The winter of our austerity"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Corporate Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid\u2019s call for restraint, however mild, on the CEO feeding frenzy at the compensation trough, seems the least objectionable statement made by a Minister in months. (Contrast this, for example, with the Agriculture Minister\u2019s warning that people should accept a further rise in food prices and blame it on drought. Or with a senior member of the Union Cabinet grumbling about the Prime Minister\u2019s austerity drive. How much money will it save if we give up first class air travel, he wanted to know.) But Mr. Khurshid\u2019s words were enough to spook the captains of industry into whines of protest which will steadily get stronger.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWe can hardly say we will shut our eyes to the salaries the CEOs are going to take,\u201d said Mr. Khurshid, hoping that companies would refrain from handing out vulgar salaries. An equally mild wish expressed by the Prime Minister in 2007 saw the media come down on Manmohan Singh like they never had before. \u201cThe Prime Minister wants CEOs to create wealth for the nation. Then he wants them to take pay cuts.\u201d That was a slogan put up by a Mumbai newspaper on huge hoardings. </p> <p class=\"body\">This time, the media were slow off the blocks in going after Mr. Khurshid. After all, between Dr. Singh\u2019s faux pas and Mr. Khurshid\u2019s mild protest was a Great Recession. And to say \u201cthe Market will decide\u201d isn\u2019t enough, any more. In 2008, the Market decided to jump off a cliff taking much of the world with it. That didn\u2019t stop CEOs in the United States from taking home billions in bonuses in a year they ran the globe into the ground. In fact, more CEOs got hikes rather than cuts in 2008, as an AFL-CIO study pointed out in April this year. In India, while millions lost their jobs and livelihoods, CEOs didn\u2019t fare too badly. (How can they, in a country where the Union budget alone gives the corporate world subsidies of Rs.700 crore every day in tax write-offs and concessions? See The Hindu, August 15, 2009). It wasn\u2019t the market which decided that $6 million of public money be gifted to the corporate sector each hour on average, it was the government. The government can though, with few qualms, cap the daily wage paid to hungry workers at NREG sites at Rs.100. That, for 100 days only \u2014 and those days to be shared by the members of each household. </p> <p class=\"body\">So the clich\u00e9s of the Market lack that warm, righteous glow they had before the meltdown. But as big business re-asserts itself, the media will find their voice. Mr. Khurshid is about to find out whose voice that is, loud and clear, if he didn\u2019t already know. And he surely knows the power of corporate links to large sections of the political class. The two highest-paid CEOs in the country managed to save Dr. Singh\u2019s previous government from falling in the July 2008 trust vote. And only recently, much of a whole session of Parliament went to discussing the fight between the same two CEOs. Mr. Khurshid\u2019s comments, however, at least make for a debate on \u2018austerity,\u2019 its practice by the political class and big business \u2014 and the ever-closer bonding between the two.</p> <p class=\"body\">Growing numbers of elected representatives fund their poll campaigns with corporate backing. And growing numbers of people with a big business background have ventured directly into the electoral arena. The links get stronger, the reps get richer. And there is much entrepreneurial joy and success. </p> <p class=\"body\">While the CEOs top the charts by miles, the vulgarity Mr. Khurshid fears also consumes much of the political class. Take for instance, the 42 MLAs re-contesting this time in Haryana\u2019s polls. On average, their assets have increased by around Rs.48 million each since 2004. A nice 388 per cent leap. That is to say, each of them added Rs.800,000 a month to their wealth in their last term. Or over Rs.1,100 for every hour that they were MLAs (for five years). A healthy rate of growth. Maybe we need a constitutional amendment requiring every Indian to serve as MLA for one term at least. It could be the biggest poverty reduction programme ever undertaken. (I mean across all States. It might be slightly chaotic if every citizen was required to be a member of the Haryana Assembly.) </p> <p class=\"body\">These and other fascinating insights abound in the reports put out by the National Election Watch on the Assembly polls in three States. (October 13 is the voting day.) NEW is a coalition of over 1,200 civil society groups across the country that also brought out excellent reports on these issues at the time of the Lok Sabha polls in April-May. Its effort to bring such data to the voting public is spearheaded by the NGO, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).</p> <p class=\"body\">Those who won the last time and seek re-election have led by example. The 388 per cent rise in assets per MLA in Haryana is but an average. Break it up and you find some stirring success stories. The top four MLAs clocking the best growth rates, all of them from the Congress, saw their assets increase by over 800 per cent. Imagine what they might have achieved had there been no austerity drive. The numero uno in this list has a rags to riches story. Starting from humble beginnings of less than a lakh, his wealth has risen 5,000 per cent. Inspiring. And perhaps one of the reasons \u2014 together with a love of democracy \u2014 why far more have been inspired to contest this time in this State than five years ago. The number of candidates is 20 per cent higher than it was in 2004. </p> <p class=\"body\">Of 489 contestants whose poll affidavits NEW was able to study, 251 \u2014 51 per cent, or every second candidate \u2014 was worth well over Rs.10 million. Though it must be conceded that those at the lower end of the crorepati chain see their assets swollen by crazy real estate rates. And as yet, these are just candidates. The crorepati ratio will go up after the results, when much of the plebeian element gets weeded out. This is not to say the austerity school has no following in Haryana. Some candidates have declared stunningly low assets. A couple of them say they\u2019re worth less than Rs.3,000 and one, poor lamb, has declared zero assets of any kind. </p> <p class=\"body\">In Maharashtra, compared to 2004, there has been a 60 per cent increase in political parties contesting elections. Also, a 33 per cent increase in candidates. NEW has thus far studied the affidavits of 880 of over 3,500 candidates seeking election to the State legislature. It found that almost one in every four candidates is a multi-millionaire. (Here too, though, there are a daring few claiming zero assets.) NEW has so far seen less than a third of candidate affidavits \u2014 and already located 212 crorepatis. Over half of these are from the four major parties, with the Congress (42) heading the austere list. The BJP, the Shiv Sena and the NCP all have 29 each among candidates surveyed. The MNS (21) and the BSP (11) don\u2019t do too badly either. All these numbers will swell when all their affidavits are studied. </p> <p class=\"body\">Around 52 per cent of Haryana\u2019s 90 sitting MLAs were multi-millionaires. That beats rich Maharashtra where just over one in three (37 per cent) makes the cut. But Maharashtra outclasses Haryana in the number of sitting MLAs with pending criminal records: 45 per cent to 31 per cent. (It might be worthwhile for NEW to correlate criminal records with crorepati status. Even if that takes more time).</p> <p class=\"body\">And finally, there are those who get elected to serve the CEO cause, bringing us back to the political class-corporate nexus. The present government of Maharashtra, for instance, has handed over 5 airports (including 601 hectares of land) for Rs.63 crore to a single corporation, as Imtiaz Jaleel\u2019s excellent report on NDTV shows. A price so low that even most of the State government\u2019s own departments opposed it. It would likely be difficult to get 601 hectares in the desert for that sum. The government\u2019s brilliant defence is that it has not privatised an inch \u2014 just leased out the airports. Yup, for 95 years for that pittance, to the Anil Ambani group. Work out the math yourselves. I hope it doesn\u2019t get any more austere than this, though.</p>", "date": "2009-10-08 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article30456.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Salman Khurshid", "CEO salary", "pay cut", "austerity", "'vulgar' salary", "political parties", "corporate companies"]}

They take on a different meaning, though, when schools are occupied by the police, as they are around Dhinkia and Govindpur, the villages resisting the State's takeover of their farmland for Posco's mega power and steel project (<i>The Hindu</i>, July 13-14).</p> <p class=\"body\">Children here grabbed national attention when they joined their parents in the protests against the forcible land acquisition. And still more when the fall in school attendance drew the wrath of Orissa's Women and Child Development Minister Anjali Behera. Her concern that children remain in school is unexceptionable. Her belief that they were not there only because they had joined the protests is misplaced.</p> <p class=\"body\">In this State, millions remaining in the classrooms are unlikely to get an education. Besides, Orissa has \u201cnot served midday meals in most schools since mid-June,\u201d says Biraj Patnaik, Adviser to the Supreme Court's Food Commissioners. \u201cAnd they are sitting on over Rs.146 crore of last year's disbursement for the scheme from the Central government.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">But back to the villages. \u201cFour of our six rooms are occupied by the police who are here to deal with the agitation,\u201d says a teacher at the Balia nodal Upper Primary School. This school runs till to Class 7. \u201cEvery morning, all the children assemble, we take attendance \u2014 and then dismiss Classes 1-5. How to teach them?\u201d The police occupy space in several schools. They have vacated one in Balituth but remain in at least four others including Balia.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cIn school,\u201d says angry 10-year-old Rakesh Bardhan in Govindpur, \u201cthey teach us the story of Baji Rout.\u201d A 13-year-old boatman and legendary Oriya hero shot dead by the British when he refused to ferry them across a river in pursuit of freedom fighters. \u201cThey tell us, \u2018you should emulate Baji Rout and the way he stood up for his homeland.' But when we stand up for ours, they react badly.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">How do their teachers feel about this? Bishwambar Mohanty, aged 14, scoffs: \u201cWhat can they say? They know that if we lose our land and village \u2014 there will be no school either.\u201d One teacher says: \u201cThey have seen police fire rubber bullets on their parents. They've seen their betel vineyards and their homes destroyed. And said that all this is good for Orissa's development. How else can they react?\u201d Another student asks: \u201cThey are turning their guns on our parents and they want us to remain in school?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">A team of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights came here, concerned by the \u201cmisuse\u201d of the children in the protests. At the end of their visit, while asking the protestors to keep children out, the team also called on the government \u201cto withdraw police forces sheltered in schools meant for the education of children.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cIf the government orders us, obviously we will find other shelters,\u201d Jagatsinghpur District Superintendent of Police S. Devdutt Singh told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p> <p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, teachers have been given the additional task of talking to the parents of \u201cabsentees.\u201d \u201cThe BDO demands a daily report on attendance and how many parents we have met,\u201d a teacher grumbles. \u201cAs if we don't have enough paperwork already, \u2018with 74 records to keep updated'.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">Govindpur Upper Primary School has 240 students and four teachers. Of these, only one is a regular teacher. The others are <i>shiksha sahayaks</i> (\u201cassistant teachers\u201d) and <i>gana sikhyak</i> (\u201cmass educator\u201d). Last month the State recruited 20,000 <i>shiksha sahayaks</i> to fill vacancies amongst regular teachers. Many <i>sahayaks </i>are poorly-trained and ill-equipped to teach. In the panchayat of the Posco area, there are only \u201cacting headmasters.\u201d In many schools across the State, the headmaster's post remains vacant for years. There are also 29,000 vacancies for primary school teachers in Orissa. \u201cThey'd have to pay more if they filled those up properly,\u201d grins one teacher. In Tirlochanpur village, 400 students go to a school without a single regular teacher.</p> <p class=\"body\">Shorn of the jargon offered under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, this amounts to recruiting \u201cteachers\u201d at pathetic salaries. <i>Shiksha sahayaks </i>get a consolidated Rs.4,000. If they last six years, they <i>might </i>be absorbed as zilla parishad teachers. The \u201c<i>gana sikhyak</i>\u201d (\u201cvolunteer teachers\u201d under the Education Guarantee Scheme) is worse off. \u201cThey are least qualified and shouldn't be teaching, but they are,\u201d says an official. They earn Rs.2,250 to Rs.2,500 a month. Less than what a landless labourer earns in 30 days of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) work. Spending less by paying \u201cteachers\u201d a pittance has helped gut the system. \u201cWhy will qualified people join this profession now?\u201d asks one.</p> <p class=\"body\">The poor quality breeds, as across the country, a huge private tuition industry. Some teachers earn more from tuitions. Others are not qualified to do even that. Some don't teach at all. And there's a welter of other problems. A spirited effort, within these limitations, to clear the mess and discipline the system by a committed Education Secretary has resulted in a backlash. Aparajita Sarangi now faces 85 cases filed against her in the courts by disgruntled school management committees and teachers.</p> <p class=\"body\">Back in Dhinkia and Govindpur, students are less visible in the protests, but are still there. \u201cNow,\u201d says one, \u201ca different small group goes each day.\u201d These children seem to be up on Mark Twain's dictum: \u201cNever let school interfere with your education.\u201d</p>", "date": "2011-07-18 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article2248021.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Posco project", "land acquisition", "education", "children's plight", "school"]}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["A candle in the wind"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The front rows of the Mumbai-Nagpur flight are usually the province of the political class: MLAs to MPs, ministers and fixers. This time, though, quite a few of the occupants were celebrities: television and film stars, major and minor, middling and mediocre. It wasn\u2019t the T-20 cricket match in Nagpur drawing them, but a far greater sport. They were going to Vidarbha for the last two days of campaigning before polling day. Shameless eavesdropping did not help us figure out which candidates specifically they were to campaign for. It wasn\u2019t evident that they knew much about that themselves. Logistics seemed a more major concern. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d grumbled one little celeb to a neighbour. \u201cYou have to travel just half an hour out of Nagpur. The place I\u2019m going is about three hours drive away.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In fairness to them, their failure to mention any issue at all they would be campaigning on was no worse (and less pretentious) than the performance of the major political parties in Maharashtra on the same score. In a State where the issues hurl themselves at you \u2014 and in a region where they kick you in the face \u2014 the opposition failed to mount a strong campaign on a single one of them. Armed with weapons that could slaughter one of the worst performing State governments in decades \u2014 from millions of job losses to food prices and the fall in food production, to the farm crisis \u2014 they did nothing. Call it electoral ahimsa. The voting public might still ram home those issues on their own in today\u2019s polling, but it could be a response divided between too many fronts.</p> <p class=\"body\">Even in Western Vidarbha which rejected the Congress-NCP in every one of its five Lok Sabha seats this May, the paralysis of the opposition is apparent. So much so that President Pratibha Patil\u2019s son, Rajendra Shekhawat, who was struggling just a week ago in Amravati, is now in the race and doing not so badly. That too against a far more experienced and locally-rooted Sunil Deshmukh \u2014 twice MLA from here and a Minister of State \u2014 who locals see as betrayed by the Congress when they denied him the ticket. The BJP candidate seems not to be in the race at all. </p> <p class=\"body\">The Sena-BJP led in 30 of Vidharbha\u2019s 62 Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha polls. The Congress-NCP in 27. But that advantage has not been anchored or expanded by the saffron front as much as it might have been. A poor choice of candidates and a lack of fire on the issues have offset any offensive. As Vidharbha\u2019s leading intellectual on agrarian issues, Vijay Jawandhia, says: \u201cThis year, the soybean crop has failed. The cotton crop is in trouble. The ground water level is twenty feet below normal for this time of year. And there will be no rabi crop. Support prices are a mess. And on the credit front, we are heading for disaster. The impact of these two successive years of drought could be worse than it was in 1972.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The Lashkari-alli (or military worm) has consumed much of the soybean crop in just days \u2014 and destroyed farmers such as Arju Kavdoji Tarekar in Seoni Rasalapur in Amravati. He tried taking his life on Independence Day after finding all the crop on his nine-acre, rain-fed farm gone overnight. \u201cI have never seen pest consume such a large area so quickly,\u201d he says. He went to appeal for help from the Tehsildar\u2019s office where \u201cthey abused me and turned me away, asking why I had come there. Where else could I go?\u201d Devastated, Tarekar tried ending his life on the spot by swallowing pesticide but failed. \u201cThe police were called in. They arrested me, took me away, detained me for a day and yelled at me: \u2018Why die here? Go die in your own fields and don\u2019t trouble us.\u2019\u201d He still receives the odd oral \u2018summons\u2019 to appear and explain his \u2018crime.\u2019 </p> <p class=\"body\">But while farmers reel under crop failure, it was hard to find this focused on in the campaigns. In a region where several candidates and re-contesting MLAs have increased their assets by over 1,000 per cent since 2004, the thrust is different. One liquor baron has sought to keep voters\u2019 spirits up in the way he knows best and at huge expense. Thousands were also out canvassing for candidates they cared little about (and may not even vote for). For people finding little or no work, the daily payment and meals on the campaign trail were welcome. The campaigns were costly, competing chaos.</p> <p class=\"body\">In a State where a single MLA increased his assets by Rs. 520 million between his election in 2004 and this year; where MLAs of the outgoing Assembly saw their assets rise by 339 per cent on average in that period, it was sobering to run into Babytai Bais. She is contesting from Wani in Yavatmal district as an independent, supported by the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS). Her aim: \u201cto unite the 7,000 farm widows and 35,000 orphans of Vidarbha whose concerns are common, to lead a life of dignity and honour.\u201d Babytai\u2019s indebted husband was one of thousands of farmers in the region who committed suicide during this past decade, crushed by the ongoing agrarian crisis. Their farm land remains in the name of his father, which leaves Babytai with nothing. Even their small house (worth Rs.50,000) that finds mention in her affidavit is not in her name. She\u2019ll be lucky to see it transferred to her son\u2019s name at some point, not her own.</p> <p class=\"body\">So what assets has she, anyway? Just one: a fixed deposit of Rs. 70,000 \u2014 exactly the compensation amount for the loss of her husband that the government placed in a bank for her. That too, in an account jointly held with the district Collector. That\u2019s it. She has nothing more. Except the candle that is her poll symbol. Babytai came into the fray very late, after Kalavati\u2019s sudden withdrawal. So she has had barely ten days to get her campaign going from scratch. Yet, she contests, taking seriously her responsibility towards thousands of other \u2018farm widows and orphans\u2019 in the region. Up against the most awesome money power, it\u2019s almost impossible for her to win, and she knows it. But she might just have lit that candle.</p>", "date": "2009-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article33086.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Vidarbha", "Maharashtra", "aseembly elections", "political parties", "Babytai", "Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti"]}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["A day at the vineyards"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Some of that legendary \u2018Banarasi pan' could have begun its journey from Gujjari Mohanty's vineyard in Govindpur, Orissa. \u201cI've sold our leaves in Benares [Varanasi] myself,\u201d says her son Sanatan. As have many of their neighbours. \u201cOur leaves are high-quality and greatly valued.\u201d The betel leaf, though, is not just about pan. It is also valued for medicinal qualities as a digestive, for the antiseptic nature of its oil, and its use along with arecanut for treating different ailments under Ayurveda.</p> <p class=\"body\">The vineyard is tiny, just a tenth of an acre (roughly 4,300 square feet). Multiple rows of bamboo and other sticks eight feet tall hold up, in all, hundreds of metres of betel vine (<i>Piper betle</i>). The vineyard is fenced off with bamboo also carrying other creepers. And a thin thatch of casuarina and coconut leaves cover the top. Casuarina leaves offer only a light shade and so make ideal \u201croofing\u201d \u2014 since some degree of sunlight is also vital. The rows are inches apart and you have to walk sideways to cross one. It's expertly organised and feels like a pleasantly air-conditioned room.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThe work is skilled but not strenuous,\u201d says Gujjari Mohanty who, past 70, handles it easily. It requires frequent but light irrigation. \u201cIt needs attention every day for brief periods,\u201d says a neighbour. \u201cBut even a weak, older person can do much of this.\u201d Some chores, though, are tougher and command twice the daily wage rate of Rs.200. In official count, Posco's project zone holds around 1,800 betel farms. Farmers here say 2,500. These vineyards would die if the farmland here were acquired for Posco's Rs.52,000-crore power and steel project. The government insists the betel farms are on forest land. The villagers, who have occupied this land for well over 80 years, demand their rights over it be recognised under the Forest Rights Act of 2006.</p> <p class=\"body\">Betel farmers in Dhinkia and Govindpur villages, home to the largest number of vineyards, are resisting the takeover of their land. \u201cWho is demanding jobs?\u201d asks Sanatan Mohanty. \u201cThere's only a demand for labour here. We pay the highest daily wage rate.\u201d Sanatan and Gujjari speak to us while tending the vineyard and while sorting the leaves at home into <i>kadas</i> (bundles of 50). In a year, they might harvest up to seven or eight lakh leaves, sometimes even 10 lakh, from this tenth of an acre. With over 2,000 farms, some of them bigger, that's a lot of leaves. And most of this is exported out of Orissa.</p> <p class=\"body\">With countless thousands of other betel farms in the State, the quantities exported are not small. Where once it all went to Benares, their produce now reaches Mumbai, Dhaka and Karachi. That's in a scenario where agriculture and forest products now account for just 0.01 per cent of Orissa's exports, according to the State's latest Economic Survey. (Mineral and metallurgical products make up over 80 per cent.) Oddly enough, the word \u2018Odisha,' which is the official name of the State, means \u201cland of farmers.\u201d But agriculture's share of GSDP is down to 18 per cent though well over 60 per cent of people depend on it. The communities here, along with other coastal folk, also have a share in Orissa's marine fish exports, already badly hit by Paradip port. Posco's planned captive port at Jatadhari would bury this sector.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cIn the first three quarters of the year we get two lakh leaves in each, in the last one around 1.2 lakh leaves,\u201d says Ranjan Swain, a betel farmer. \u201cThat lower yield is in the three winter months, but the quality improves and prices double in that period.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cFor the first six lakh leaves,\u201d points out Jagadish Pradhan of the Odisha Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (the Orissa village self-rule campaign), \u201cthey get Rs.450 per thousand leaves on average. That gives them around Rs.2.7 lakhs. For the remaining 1.2 lakh winter leaves they make a rupee a leaf. In all, a total of Rs.3.9 lakh.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The over 540 work days this produces in a year in 4,000 to 5,000 square feet means a labour cost of Rs.1.5 lakh, calculates Pradhan. The wage rate here at Rs.200 and higher is above what a construction worker in Bhubaneswar gets. But workers taking on tasks like lifting and tying of the creepers command up to Rs.500 a day. Those handling manure application, Rs.400. Workers doing earth filling and fencing claim Rs.350 a day. These tasks though last fewer days in a year. It means, however, that even landless workers are unenthusiastic about Posco's project.</p> <p class=\"body\">On average, the wage paid out is almost double the State's MNREGS rate of Rs.125. And it comes with a good meal. Then there are the costs on organic manure (oil cake), the wooden poles, bamboo pieces, rope wire, pump set maintenance. These add up to another Rs.50,000. \u201cThere are no transportation costs. The merchants pick them up from our doorstep in vans. There are a few other costs, but minor ones.\u201d (As in much of rural India, farmers never count their family labour as a cost). After a total expenditure of around Rs.2 lakhs, they're left with between Rs.1.5 to Rs.2 lakhs each year. \u201cAnd some of them,\u201d observes Pradhan, \u201chave more than one vineyard.\u201d Sanatan has four. Barring a brief period after the 1999 super-cyclone, several here have managed their farms largely without bank loans. </p> <p class=\"body\">On the three acres his family have apart from the vineyards, Sanatan has over 70 species of trees, plants, fruit and medicinal herbs. (He takes one yield of paddy from a limited patch for his family's consumption.) This too is a good source of income.</p> <p class=\"body\">Against this, the compensation the State is offering betel farms works out to Rs.1.15 lakh for a tenth of an acre farm like the one we're in now. \u201cImagine what we would lose,\u201d says Sanatan. A thought shared by thousands of others. \u201cAll this for a project that has a life of 30 years. And who will give us our prawns, our fish, our wind, our highly fertile lands, our weather and climate?\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cI have spent nearly ten lakhs on educating my four children in the past several years. I am building a house that costs a little less than that. We don't need their compensation. We need our livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cDo they think we're idiots when they talk about jobs?\u201d asks Gujjari. \u201cEvery thing is getting mechanised. Who goes today to the post office, buys Rs.5 stamps, and sends letters when there are mobile phones?\u201d</p>", "date": "2011-07-14 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article2224641.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["betel farms", "pan vineyards", "Posco"]}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["Farm suicides: a 12-year saga"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">The loan waiver year of 2008 saw 16,196 farm suicides in the country, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Compared to 2007, that\u2019s a fall of just 436. As economist Professor K. Nagaraj who has worked in-depth on farm suicide data says, \u201cthe numbers leave little room for comfort and none at all for self-congratulation.\u201d There were no major changes in the trend that set in from the late 1990s and worsened after 2002. The dismal truth is that very high numbers of farm suicides still occur within a fast decreasing farm population. </p> <p class=\"body\">Between just the Census of 1991 and that of 2001, nearly 8 million cultivators quit farming. A year from now, the 2011 Census will tell us how many more quit in this decade. It is not likely to be less. It could even dwarf that 8 million figure as the exodus from farming probably intensified after 2001. The State-wise farm suicide ratios \u2014 number of farmers committing suicide per 100,000 farmers \u2014 are still pegged on the outdated 2001 figures. So the 2011 Census, with more authentic counts of how many farmers there really are, might provide an unhappy update on what is going on.</p> <p class=\"body\">Focussing on farm suicides as a share of total suicides in India misleads. That way, it\u2019s \u201caha! the percentage is coming down.\u201d That\u2019s silly. For one thing, the total number of suicides (all groups, not just farmers) is increasing \u2014 in a growing population. Farm suicides are rising within a declining farm population. Two, an all-India picture disguises the intensity. The devastation lies in the Big 5 States (Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh). These account for two-thirds of all farm suicides during 2003-08. Take just the Big 5 \u2014 their percentage of all farm suicides has gone up. Worse, even their percentage of total all-India suicides (all categories) has risen. Poor States like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are doing very badly for some years now.</p> <p class=\"body\">In the period 1997-2002, farm suicides in the Big 5 States accounted for roughly one out of every 12 of all suicides in the country. In 2003-08, they accounted for nearly one out of every 10. </p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB now has farm suicide data for 12 years. Actually, farm data appear in its records from 1995 onwards, but some States failed to report for the first two years. Hence 1997, from when all States are reporting their farm suicide data, is a more reliable base year. The NCRB has also made access much easier by placing all past years of \u201cAccidental Deaths &amp; Suicides in India\u201d reports on its website. </p> <p class=\"body\">The 12-year period allows us to compare farm suicide numbers for 1997-2002, with how they turned out in the next 6-year period of 2003-2008. All 12 years were pretty bad, but the latter six were decidedly worse.</p> <p class=\"body\">Reading a \u2018trend\u2019 into a single year\u2019s dip or rise is misleading. Better to look at 3-year or 6-year periods within 1997-2008. For instance, Maharashtra saw a decline in farm suicide numbers in 2005, but the very next year proved to be its worst ever. Since 2006, the State has been the focus of many initiatives. Manmohan Singh\u2019s visit to Vidharbha that year brought the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s Relief Package\u201d of Rs.3,750 crore for six crisis-ridden districts of the region. This came atop Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh\u2019s Rs.1,075 crore \u201cCM\u2019s relief package.\u201d Then followed the nearly Rs.9,000 crore that was Maharashtra\u2019s share of the Rs.70,000-crore Central loan waiver for farmers. To which the State government added Rs.6,200 crore for those farmers not covered by the waiver. The State added Rs.500 crore for a one-time settlement (OTS) for poor farmers who had been excluded from the waiver altogether because they owned over five acres of land. </p> <p class=\"body\">In all, the amounts committed to fighting the agrarian crisis in Maharashtra exceeded Rs. 20,000 crore across 2006, 2007 and 2008. (And that\u2019s not counting huge handouts to the sugar barons.) Yet, that proved to be the worst three-year period ever for any State at any time since the recording of farm data began. In 2006-08, Maharashtra saw 12, 493 farm suicides. That is nearly 600 more than the previous worst of 2002-2005 and 85 per cent higher than the 6,745 suicides recorded in the three-year period of 1997-1999. The same government was in power, incidentally, in the worst six years. Besides, these higher numbers are emerging within a shrinking farm population. By 2001, 42 per cent of Maharashtra\u2019s population was already urban. Its farmer base has certainly not grown. </p> <p class=\"body\">So was the loan waiver useless? The idea of a waiver was not a bad thing. And it was right to intervene. More that the specific actions were misguided and bungled. Yet it could also be argued that but for the relief the waiver brought to some farmers at least, the suicide numbers of 2008 could have been a lot worse. The waiver was a welcome step for farmers, but its architecture was flawed. A point strongly made in this journal ( Oh! What a lovely waiver, March 10, 2008). It dealt only with bank credit and ignored moneylender debt. So only those farmers with access to institutional credit would benefit. Tenant farmers in Andhra Pradesh and poor farmers in Vidharbha and elsewhere get their loans mainly from moneylenders. So, in fact, farmers in Kerala, where everyone has a bank account, were more likely to gain. (Kerala was also the one State to address the issue of moneylender debt.) </p> <p class=\"body\">The 2008 waiver also excluded those holding over five acres, making no distinction between irrigated and unirrigated land. This devastated many struggling farmers with eight or 10 acres of poor, dry land. On the other hand, West Bengal\u2019s farmers, giant numbers of small holders below the 5-acre limit, stood to gain far more. </p> <p class=\"body\">Every suicide has a multiplicity of causes. But when you have nearly 200,000 of them, it makes sense to seek broad common factors within that group. Within those reasons. As Dr. Nagaraj has repeatedly pointed out, the suicides appear concentrated in regions of high commercialisation of agriculture and very high peasant debt. Cash crop farmers seemed far more vulnerable to suicide than those growing food crops. Yet the basic underlying causes of the crisis remained untouched. The predatory commercialisation of the countryside; a massive decline in investment in agriculture; the withdrawal of bank credit at a time of soaring input prices; the crash in farm incomes combined with an explosion of cultivation costs; the shifting of millions from food crop to cash crop cultivation with all its risks; the corporate hijack of every major sector of agriculture including, and especially, seed; growing water stress and moves towards privatisation of that resource. The government was trying to beat the crisis \u2014 leaving in place all its causes \u2014 with a one-off waiver. </p> <p class=\"body\">In late 2007, The Hindu carried (Nov. 12-15) the sorry result emerging from Dr. Nagaraj\u2019s study of NCRB data: that nearly 1.5 lakh peasants had ended their lives in despair between 1997 and 2005. Just days later, Union Minister for Agriculture Sharad Pawar confirmed those figures in Parliament (Rajya Sabha Starred Question No. 238, Nov. 30, 2007) citing the same NCRB data. It\u2019s tragic that 27 months later, the paper had to run a headline saying that the number had climbed to nearly 2 lakh. The crisis is very much with us. Mocking its victims, heckling its critics. And cosmetic changes won\u2019t make it go away. </p> <p class=\"body\">In 2006-08, Maharashtra saw 12, 493 farm suicides.

{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["How to be an \u2018eligible suicide\u2019"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Kafka might have envied the script. In Delhi, Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar informed the Rajya Sabha on May 7 that there had been just six farmers' suicides in Vidarbha since January. The same day, same time in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said that figure was 343. That is, 57 times greater than Mr. Pawar's count. Mr. Chavan was speaking in Vidarbha. Mr. Pawar's numbers came in a written reply to a question in Parliament. Both stories were reported by the Press Trust of India (PTI). All in a day's work.</p> <p class=\"body\">Confused? Try this: Five days earlier, Minister of State for Agriculture K.V. Thomas pitched his count at 23 suicides in Vidarbha since January. In the same week \u2014 in the same Rajya Sabha. And Mr. Thomas said his source was \u201cthe government of Maharashtra.\u201d Whose chief minister says the number is 343. Meanwhile, before Mr. Pawar gave the figure of 'only six' in four months, the government's Vasantrao Naik Farmers' Self Reliance Mission in Vidarbha put the number at 62 for just January alone.</p> <p class=\"body\">Can estimates of farm suicides \u2014 all of them official \u2014 vary by over 5,500 per cent? (Mr. Chavan's is that much higher than Mr. Pawar's). But it doesn't end there. Maharashtra Revenue Minister Narayan Rane informed the State Assembly in April that there have been 5,574 suicides in Vidarbha since 2006. But Parliament is told only six have occurred since January this year. Mr. Rane's count for the whole state since 2006 is 7,786 farm suicides. <i>That is more than double Mr. Pawar's new count of 3,450 for the whole country in the last three years</i>.</p> <p class=\"body\">That's odd \u2014 3,450 for the whole country? In three years? The National Crime Records Bureau puts the number in the last three years at nearly 50,000. That is for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (the last year for which data are available). And the NCRB is the only source for farm suicide data at the national level. Its data also show us that nearly 200,000 farmers have killed themselves between 1997 and 2008. So whose numbers are being fed to Parliament? And how come we have so many wildly varying counts? That too when there is only one body with authentic data. And why does this happen mostly with Maharashtra?</p> <p class=\"body\">Because Maharashtra's numbers are the worst in the country. This state has seen 41,404 farmers' suicides since 1997. Of these, 12,493 have occurred in 2006-08. So the pressure to cover up is greater here than anywhere else.</p> <p class=\"body\">The concern was never about the farmer. Till the Prime Minister's 2006 Vidarbha visit, the state's top ministers had never been to a distress-hit village on this issue. Most have still not visited a single suicide-hit farm household. They cared little for what people thought of them. But they did fear the displeasure of their own high command in New Delhi \u2014 by then alarmed at the rising suicide numbers. So they began massaging the figures.</p> <p class=\"body\">First, this meant attaching an impossible number of indicators to identify a farm suicide. As early as June 2005, people in Malwagad, Yavatmal were mocking the process when we arrived there after the suicide of Digambar Agose. \u201cNow we can't even commit suicide in peace,\u201d laughed one of Agose's neighbours with graveyard humour. \u201cNot without reading those forms the officials have created to see we get it right.\u201d Another pointed out: \u201cThere are some 40 clauses on their inquiry list. All these must apply.\u201d In short, if you must kill yourself, get it right. Make sure you adhere to the <i>pro forma</i>. Then your family is \u2018eligible' for compensation.</p> <p class=\"body\">Hundreds of people were dropped from the farm suicide lists on the ground that they were not farmers. \u201cThere's no land in their names,\u201d officials asserted. On the ground, this meant most women farmers taking their lives were excluded. As also, many eldest sons who actually ran the farm while the land remained in their aged fathers' names. The lists also shut out many dalit and adivasi peasants \u2014 whose title to land is seldom clear.</p> <p class=\"body\">And yet the numbers kept mounting. The reporting of the issue was hurting where it mattered: in Delhi. So how to bring down the count? Ambitious bureaucrats stepped forward to create new categories. 'Eligible' and 'ineligible' suicides. Only the former would be counted as \u201cfarm suicides.\u201d An official document set this trend in 2006.</p> <p class=\"body\">It created a table with many new columns. With each of these, the numbers fell. How? After the total or farm suicides, came a new group: \u201cFamily members' suicides.\u201d This means family members on the farm killing themselves are not counted as farmers. That helped skim down the figure still more. Next, an \u201cInvestigated Cases\u201d column that saw numbers plummet further. The final column was truly novel \u2014 \u201cEligible Suicides.\u201d That is, those the government deems worthy of compensation. And so, for 2005, the suicides column that begins at 2,425 ends with 273. (Less than 12 per cent of the total). This amputated figure becomes the official farm suicides count. And a \u2018decline' is established.</p> <p class=\"body\">And so the coming of \u2018non-genuine suicides.' This did not mean the man was any less dead. Or that he had not killed himself. It meant the government could not accept his death had been driven by debt and distress. (Even though quite a few suicide notes cited precisely those reasons.) Committees were set up in the crisis districts to check if the suicides were \u2018genuine.' These bodies soon ran berserk, often declaring every single suicide in a month to be \u2018non-genuine.' Their hatchet job means that very few families suffering a breadwinner's suicide get any compensation from government.</p> <p class=\"body\">And that's how it's still done. Mr. Rane's reply to a question in the state assembly lists <i>thousands</i> of \u2018ineligible suicides' over four years.</p> <p class=\"body\">The problem of the NCRB's data however, remains. These are not in their hands to fudge. Sure, over time, even the NCRB's data will be corrupted by the fiddles at the ground level. But it is the here and now of politics that matters. The only way to get around this is to simply ignore the NCRB. So the Minister's written reply in Parliament makes no mention of it. You can see the change from the past.</p> <p class=\"body\">NCRB data was precisely what he cited in 2007 when confirming there had been nearly 1.5 lakh farm suicides between 1997 and 2005. Replying to Starred Question No. 238 in the Rajya Sabha (Nov. 30, 2007), Mr. Pawar's numbers tallied to the last digit with those reported in <i>The Hindu</i> (Nov.12-17) two weeks earlier. <i>The Hindu</i>'s reports were based on the comprehensive study of official data on farm suicides by Professor K. Nagaraj, then with the Madras Institute of Development Studies. The data analysed by him were from the NCRB. It publishes these in its Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI) report each year. A part of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, the NCRB is the only body that exists, which tracks suicides of all categories across the country.</p> <p class=\"body\">Following Dr. Nagaraj's study, <i>The Hindu</i> updated the farm suicide figures each year, drawing from the latest NCRB reports. (All these reports are available on their website. For instance, the 2008 data in the category of \u201cSelf Employed (Farming / Agriculture)\u201d counts farmers' suicides for that year as <i>16,196</i>. (Check it yourselves on http://ncrb.nic.in/ADSI2008/table-2.11.pdf ). But in Mr. Pawar's Rajya Sabha reply this May, that figure is 1,237 (no source cited. At least not in the PTI report). To date, neither central nor state government has ever contradicted the NCRB-based figures of Dr. Nagaraj and <i>The Hindu</i>. They're too busy contradicting their own.</p> <p class=\"body\">Simply put, governments are doing the same things they do with poverty estimates. With BPL counts, APL numbers, ration cards and so on. With farm suicides \u2014 real human deaths are involved. The pressure to fudge gets more acute with public revulsion over the plight of farmers.</p> <p class=\"body\">Yet, the 2011 Census could make things look a lot worse. It will tell us how many farmers there really are now in each state. In states like Maharashtra, they are likely to be far fewer than they were in 2001. (The 2001 Census showed that 8 million people had quit farming since 1991). Till today, all the Farm Suicide Rates (suicides per 100,000 farmers) worked out by Dr. Nagaraj are based on 2001 figures. The FSR for Maharashtra, for instance, is 29.9. That could look a lot worse \u2014 and the suicides far more intense \u2014 when the new Census figures on farmers are out. But the fiddles and fudging will go on.</p>", "date": "2010-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article428367.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["suicides", "farmers"]}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["Nearly 2 lakh farm suicides since 1997"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">There were at least 16,196 farmers\u2019 suicides in India in 2008, bringing the total since 1997 to 199,132, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).</p> <p class=\"body\">The share of the Big 5 States or \u2018suicide belt\u2019 in 2008 \u2014 Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh \u2014 remained very high at 10,797, or 66.6 per cent of the total farm suicides in the country. This was marginally higher than it was in 2007 (66.2 per cent). Maharashtra remains the worst State in the nation for farm suicides with a total of 3802. (This is just 40 short of the combined total of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.) The all-India total of 16,196 represents a fall of 436 from 2007. But the broad trends of the past decade reflect no significant change. The national average for farm suicides since 2003 stays at roughly one every 30 minutes.</p> <p class=\"body\">Within the Big 5, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh recorded higher numbers. The increase of 604 in these three States somewhat offset the dip in Maharashtra (436) and Karnataka (398). But a fall in suicide numbers in other States (for example, a decline of 412 in Kerala and 343 in West Bengal) means that the Big 5 marginally increased their two-thirds share of total farm suicides in 2008.</p> <p class=\"body\">The NCRB data now cover all States for 12 years from 1997. In the first six years (1997-2002), the Big 5 witnessed 55,769 farmers\u2019 suicides. From 2003 to 2008, they totalled 67,054, a rise of nearly 1900 a year on average.</p> <p class=\"body\">Maharashtra has logged 41,404 farm suicides from 1997 (over a fifth of the national total) and 44,468 from 1995, the year when this State began recording farm data. No other State comes close. During 1997-2002, Maharashtra saw, on average, eight farmers kill themselves daily. The corresponding figure rose to 11 during 2003-2008. The rise was from an average of 2,833 farm suicides a year in the first period to an average of 4,067 in the next period.</p> <p class=\"body\">Professor K. Nagaraj, an economist who has worked at the Madras Institute of Development Studies, says of the NCRB data: \u201cThere is hardly any decline in the suicide belt, though individual States may show variations across 12 years. If this is the state for 2008, the year of the Rs. 70,000 crore loan waiver and multiple farm packages, then 2009, a drought year, could show very disturbing figures. The underlying agrarian problems seem as acute as ever.\u201d</p>", "date": "2010-01-22 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article87699.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["farmer suicides", "National Crime Records Bureau", "suicide belt", "Maharashtra", "Andhra Pradesh", "Karnataka", "Madhya Pradesh", "Chhattisgarh"]}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["The agony & the ajaat"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Amitabh Bachchan says that if ever asked about his caste by Census enumerators, his answer would be: Caste \u2013 Indian. That, of course, would do little more than stoke the media's bollywood feeding frenzy yet again. Shyam Maharaj is no Bachchan. Nor is his brother, Chaitanya Prabhu. But they and the followers of their fraternity will likely throw up far more complex answers \u2014 and questions \u2014 if Census enumerators do finally pop that query on caste. \u201cOur answer: we are <i>ajaat</i>. Here is my school leaving certificate to prove that. But you can write what you like,\u201d Prabhu tells us at his house in Mangrul (Dastgir) village of Amravati district.</p> <p class=\"body\"><i>Ajaat</i>: this literally means ones without caste. The <i>ajaat</i> was a bold social movement of the 1920s and '30s that at its peak had tens of thousands of committed followers in what are present-day Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. It was led by the colourful and eccentric social reformer Ganpati Bhabhutkar better known as Ganpati Maharaj. Chaitanya Prabhu and Shyam Maharaj are his surviving grandsons. Apart from the usual anti-liquor and anti-violence norms of such movements, Ganpati Maharaj threw in others. He attacked caste frontally. Many stopped idol worship at his call. He pressed for gender equality and even railed against private property. And, in the 1930s, he and his followers declared themselves as \u2018<i>ajaat</i>.'</p> <p class=\"body\">His inter-caste dining drive raised hackles in the villages he worked in. As one of his disciples P. L. Nimkar put it: \u201che would ask his followers from all castes to bring cooked food from their homes. This, he would mix up totally and distribute the mix as prasad.\u201d Caste was his great target. \u201cInter-caste weddings and widow remarriage \u2014 that's what he sought and achieved,\u201d says Prabhu. \u201cIn our own family, from granddad to us, we married into eleven different castes, from brahmins to dalits. In our extended family there have been scores of such weddings. Ganpati Maharaj himself had such a marriage.\u201d He also \u201ccreated the religion of \u2018<i>maanav</i>' (humanity) and opened the temple here to dalits, offending the upper castes,\u201d says Shyam Maharaj. \u201cThey filed cases against him and no one would touch his case. All the <i>vakils</i> here at the time were brahmins.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">The movement waned over years, as some followers left on the caste issue, and with its Gurus's death in 1944. (He is buried at a community centre he built here decades ago, just opposite Prabhu's home). Still, it remained known and respected for some time after independence. \u201cSee my school leaving certificate,\u201d says Prabhu, showing it to us. \u201cAs late as the 1960s, even the \u201870s, we still got certificates calling us <i>ajaat</i>. Now, schools and colleges say they've never heard of us and won't give our children admission.\u201d The surviving <i>ajaat</i> are not doing too well. Shyam and Prabhu just about make ends meet as petty agricultural traders.</p> <p class=\"body\">Forgotten by the late \u201870s, the <i>ajaat</i> were re-discovered some years ago by Nagpur journalists Atul Pandey and Jaideep Hardikar who wrote about their plight in Marathi and English respectively. Their reports sparked a Maharashtra government move to help them. But that died with the exit of the one senior official who had shown interest in the matter.</p> <p class=\"body\"><i>Ajaat</i> candidates can't contest panchayat polls. Poll officials refuse to accept their forms \u2014 which state no caste. \u201c<i>Ajaat</i> folk can't get ration cards without a huge struggle,\u201d says Prabhu. College admissions, scholarships and government jobs elude them for the same reasons. Other villagers won't marry into these families now as their caste status lacks clarity. In short, the followers of a once proud anti-caste reform movement have been reduced to a couple of thousand people viewed as something like a caste themselves.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cMy niece Sunaina could not get into college,\u201d says Prabhu. \u201cThe college said: \u2018we don't recognise this <i>ajaat.</i> Bring us a proper caste certificate and we'll admit her'.\u201d His nephew Manoj who did finally make it to college says: \u201cThey treat us as an oddity there. There were no scholarships for any of us. No one there believes such a thing as <i>ajaat</i> exists.\u201d A restless younger generation feels imprisoned by the past. Many of the <i>ajaat</i>, including Prabhu's family, have faced the ignominy of having to trace out an ancestor whose caste could be clearly proven.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cImagine our humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to take out caste certificates for our children.\u201d Not easy, given the generations of inter-caste marriages these families have seen. And even the ledger of the village kotwal lists them as \u2018<i>ajaat</i>.' Some have had to trace a great grandfather whose caste could be established. \u201cTo recover and rebuild those old records is a horrible job,\u201d says Prabhu. \u201cThe authorities suspect us of concealing things and faking our caste. And it hurts us like anything to make these caste certificates. But without them our children are truly stuck.\u201d Sadly, they had no choice but to trace out the caste origin of anti-caste crusader Ganpati Maharaj himself. That was needed for his great-grandchildren.</p> <p class=\"body\">Quite a few of the remaining 2,000 or so <i>ajaat</i> gather at that centre in this village in November each year. \u201cNow there is only one such family we have contact with in Madhya Pradesh,\u201d says a glum Prabhu. The rest are in Maharashtra. \u201cOnly 105 are formally registered with our body, the <i>ajaatiya maanav sanstha</i>. But far more than that come to our annual meeting. However, consider that we once had 60,000 members in this movement.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWe need a much more comprehensive survey of caste than the mere introduction of a question in the Census will permit,\u201d says economist Dr. K. Nagaraj (formerly with the Madras Institute of Development Studies) who has worked on the subject. \u201cThat we need caste data is beyond doubt. But we need that data in a frame that captures the huge diversity, location-specific nature, and the many other complexities of caste. A single question in the 2011 census will not achieve that. This is perhaps a job for the National Sample Survey and its team of trained investigators with much advance preparation.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">So what happens if that enumerator does come around to your house with the question on caste? \u201cBelieve me,\u201d says Prabhu, \u201cIt will confuse him. I think they should create a different category in the Census for people like us. We must declare who we are. We have fought against everything that stands for caste. But in this society, caste is in everything.\u201d</p>", "date": "2010-06-04 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article445810.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["Social reform", "anti-caste movement", "Ajaat"]}
{"author": ["P. Sainath"], "title": ["NREGS: not caste in stone"], "content": "<p class=\"body\">Balijas, Reddys and other upper or dominant castes working on improving the lands of Dalits? It\u2019s happening here in Kondama Naiyuni Palayam village of Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh. Call it necessity. Call it NREGS. The heavy late rains may have brought relief to Rayalaseema region in terms of fodder, and drinking water. But they also devastate the short duration crops that people have sown. So this village and its neighbours are heavily NREG dependent.</p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cWe work together, all of us, and not on a caste basis,\u201d say E. Ravi and K. Maheshwar, both Balijas. NREGS work priorities are clear here. The land development programme under it must first exhaust dalit and adivasi households before serving the others. In places like K.N. Palayam, where the villagers are organised, this actually gets done. It is not the same everywhere. And it would be rash to conclude that the NREGS is breaking down social hierarchies big time. It is certainly calling them into question, though.</p> <p class=\"body\">There is also economic necessity. \u201cEven people with 25 acres in our rainfed farms seek NREGS work, says Narasimha Reddy in Palacherla village. Yes, he confirms, most landowning Reddy households in this village of 350 families are reporting for NREG work \u2014 a big shift in attitudes. About 400 people \u2014 an equal number of men and women \u2014 go to the NREG site.</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Impact on social structures</b></p> <p class=\"body\">Within limits, says Malla Reddy, a 35-year veteran of NGO activism here, the NREGS does impact on social structures. Now, when landowners call Dalits or Adivasis to work, they are relatively more respectful. Because the labourers have the option of Rs. 100 a day work here.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In K.N. Palayam, groups like the Rural and Environment Development Society have sharpened that impact. REDS has managed a creative interpretation of NREG rules locally. \u201cYou\u2019ll find several households that have exceeded 100 days work,\u201d says C. Bhanuja, President of REDS. We did.</p> <p class=\"body\">It isn\u2019t all quite simple, however. Both, the programmes\u2019 own problems and those within the economy and society surface often. A full fifth of those seeking work in K.N. Palayam are over 60 years of age. S. Kadhar Wali, who is well over 70, puts it simply: \u201cWhy work at 70? You may as well ask, why eat at 70.\u201d He and his wife S. Bibi have been doing NREGS work from 2006. This year, Bibi dropped out after a bout of typhoid. \u201cWe returned to work as the rise in food prices has destroyed poor people these past few years.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\">In Aiyaram Gopalapadu, Kurnool, ex-Sarpanch C. Sankaraiah, clings to the old hierarchies. \u201cI won\u2019t do it,\u201d he says, dismissing NREG work. \u201cI own nine acres. It\u2019s insulting.\u201d But what about those 30-acre rainfed farmers in Anantapur, spotted at NREG sites? \u201cAnantapur politics are very different from our politics here.\u201d But one of his sons is working at the very site he leads us to.</p> <p class=\"body\">Contradictions do plague the NREGS in its present avatar. One, between landowners and landless labourers. \u201cThis Rs. 100 a day wage is killing us,\u201d grumble many of the bigger landowners. Actually, most workers average Rs. 80. But the bigger owners are hostile. And then there are the small and medium land holders. They employ wage labour \u2014 but also work at NREG sites themselves to make ends meet. \u201cThis wage is hurting our farming operations and driving the price rise,\u201d goes the chorus in Palavai, Palacherla and elsewhere. </p> <p class=\"body\">The same voices protest when asked what they would do if the NREG wage fell to Rs. 50 tomorrow. \u201cHow will we survive? We need this wage.\u201d These are people owning between 5 and 8 acres. </p> <p class=\"body\">The late rains stoke the farmer-labourer contradiction. The farmers want NREGS put on hold so they can attend to their fields and find labour for them. The landless cannot afford to go without work for any length of time. That\u2019s when migrations surface again, though overall, the programme has reduced them considerably. That\u2019s the case in K. Nagalapuram in Kurnool, where we run into many labourers leaving for Bangalore. Another universal complaint is about payment delays. \u201cThese are killing,\u201d says Somappa as he departs for Bangalore. </p> <p class=\"body\">There is also the odd village where the NREG has been captured by local mafias determined to keep the wages down. As In Harekal in Kurnool district where NREGS work vanished for months. (However work resumed the next day following a report in Eenadu after our visit.) Or in Pothireddypalli in Mahbubnagar, where the priority for work on Dalit lands is being subverted. Tractor owners evade land development work on Dalit farms. \u201cOur bills will never be settled,\u201d claims one of them. In Anantapur, the Lambada adivasis of Kareddypalli tanda are bogged down by bureaucratic quibbles and local tensions. \u201cOur tanda is in Kadiri Mandal [rural],\u201d points out T. Nagesh. \u201cBut our fields are just yards away in the next, Nallacheruvu mandal. The people there won\u2019t let us work and the officials do nothing.\u201d And so several in the tanda have migrated \u2014 to Kerala. </p> <p class=\"body\">And there is the work itself. The broad success of NREGS in states like Andhra has seen some romanticise it. You only have to attempt the body-sapping work that a hungry malnourished people do, in sizzling temperatures, to swiftly abandon such ideas. Hearing of NREG \u201cboycotts\u201d in villages like Sanevaripalli in Anantapur, we went there. \u201cWhat boycott?\u201d asks Nagappa, who owns five acres here. \u201cThey give us impossible work. See this rocky land. Don\u2019t tell us about trenching and digging, just try it yourself in this hard and dry soil. And what will it achieve? Why can\u2019t they give us sensible work which we can do.\u201d</p> <p class=\"body\"><b>Not insurmountable</b></p> <p class=\"body\">\u201cThese are not insurmountable problems,\u201d says Malla Reddy. \u201cThe people of this village themselves are showing us alternatives within the NREGS.\u201d They show us large tracts of land that can be made cultivable removing the small but heavy rocks that dot them. \u201cThen there is the development of common lands with vegetation and fodder. Farm ponds could also prove crucial. You have to be imaginative and use diverse approaches across regions. In Anantapur for instance, we have forests without trees. The regeneration of those could be a major work. In zones like these, rain-fed horticulture development would help. And in fact, we should be creating work for landless and small farmers round the year. We need very strict enforcement of priorities that demand Dalit and Adivasi lands be the first to benefit. Finally, it means dumping the 100-day per household yearly limit on work. All this can only happen when you move from piecemeal action to integrated, long-term planning.\u201d</p>", "date": "2009-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "link": ["http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article19803.ece"], "location": "\n", "keywords": ["NREGS", "P.
